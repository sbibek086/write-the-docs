We are victims of our own faulty habits and thought patterns. So, I spent most of my 20s in pressure cooker conventional exam conditions, which demand that you need to know all formulas by heart (what rubbish?), all principles like second natured. So, it shaped my preconditioning in such a way that I need to know all parts by heart before I dare to wet my feet in problem solving ocean. 
     But real world or lets be confined to programming challenges does not work like that. We need to have that problem solving methodology - thats it. Lots of knows are learnt while on the flow of problem solving. Tho I breathe it consciously, my subconscious brain masks me - Vivek, you need to know all parts beforehand, you need to know all parts beforehand.
    Below conversation exemplifies this - post-er seems to be know-it-all-before kind of guy and commenter is not.
