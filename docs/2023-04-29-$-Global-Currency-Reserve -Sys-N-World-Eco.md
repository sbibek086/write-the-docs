title: Dollar Global Currency Reserve System & World Eco

Dollar is Global Currency Reserve System because to do any international trade, for eg. China to buy 
, it needs to do it in dollar and not in its Yuan.
After Europe decimated itself with two world wars, meanwhile US was picking up pieces, and was able to put dollar as global currency reserve system. That said, its easy to see why Gold is neutral global reserve system.
It led to:
- Dollar valuation increased because even China needs dollar to buy petrol from Saudi. Now, we can understand why BRICS- Russia, China, Brazil, India and S africa are trying to come up w new international currency of their own.
- US could print its dollar without being liable to even UK and anyone else. Earlier UK was boss because even US had to deposit some equivalent gold to London banks to print dollar but after President Nixon, it changed.

But being global currency reserve system is BOON but curse as well.
If we look at US internal domestic economy, Gini coefficient is at 0.4 sthg - worse than some other 1st world countries. 
Btw, gini coefficient acts like this: For eg, in a room of 5 people, if 1 people holds all wealth, Gini = 1 & if all people holds equal wealth, then Gini = 0.

So, how did it happen?
Now, lets enter rabbit hole:


So, world economy ups and downs is because of two factors, if we ousted Europe from equation as it f**ked itself post two WW.
So, we get Asia (= majorly China, Japan and others) as merchantilist economy, which basically is - "Bust your ass up on exports, zero imports and we will grow as collectivist economy NOT individualistic economy". It means their principal is - reduce labour wages so that they could produce cheaper goods so that they can sell to US to gain dollars.

Simply put, game goes like this:
US buys stuff from Asia in dollars. Asia uses those dollars to buy energy and raw materials from the rest of the world, so it can produce more stuff for the US. 
Asia now has a lot of excess dollars that it earned from selling stuff, and it can do two things with those dollars: 
Option 1: Buy dollar-denominated assets. 
Option 2: Sell dollars in exchange for local currencies and give some of the earnings back to workers in the form of higher wages.
Post WW2 eco, ie mentioned above game would not be possible with below being true:
i) US has OPEN CAPITAL economy (unlike Asia's close), which is - any parts of world can bring any amount dollars and buy whatever size properties you want. And that's IN-ing dollar back. 
ii) America has little to no tariffs on imported goods. No country practises truly free trade, but America has always made it a priority to offer as close to free trade as possible. Without little to no tariffs on Asian stuff, Asia would not have been able to sell things to Americans for cheaper than American companies could produce domestically.

So, Asia needs more dollars by selling their stuffs to US so that they can buy international assets in usd (remember, usd is global currency). 
And so here, being global currency reserve sys becomes curse. 
Why? because irrespective of whether US domestic eco needs more money or not (btw US nationalists would ofcourse against more moeny printing as it deflates their money aka INFLATION), Fed reserve and Treasury is pressured to print more - why? global reserve currency means that the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Treasury must print or provide dollars by whatever means necessary whenever the global economy demands them. Now, who will Fed and Treasury favor - ofcourse world economy demand because they must in order to prevent a financial crisis that makes the dollar more expensive and lowers its supply globally.

So, Fed would LOWER INTEREST RATES (Fed is BANK of banks. so, when Fed lowers I, then banks would get more I by instead lending out to public which solves liquidity crisis among public) to BAIL OUT and save banks. {How Fed lowering I bails out and save banks, I will edit add here}

Above was about how dollar being global currency reserve sys impacts its internal banking system.
Now, what about American financial assets.

see from this chart, financial assets like stocks and property received a significant boost from globalisation. The more the world trades, the more dollars need to be recycled into the US. US labour did not receive the same benefits, though, as evidenced by the lone falling purple line, which represents the share of manufacturing value added as a % of US GDP. Basically, if you’re an American, you’re much better off learning financial engineering than how to engineer the actual making of goods.

Also, we can see S and P 500 index == US corporate profit margins are at the highest they have been since the 1950’s. However, in the 1950’s, the US was the world’s workshop (since everyone else was destitute after the ravages of WW2). 
In 2023, China occupies that role of world's workshop — and yet US companies are still enjoying profit margins (& as result S&P 500 index) that are similar to those experienced during the height of the US’ manufacturing prowess.
(btw S&P 500 index = x * stock of blue chip silicon valley comapanies like FANG stock price + y * stock price of another inversely related assets like health companies + z* etc etc) (so S&P 500 is equity index fund of US == literally world eco  , thus dictates how much money is at world)  (so we see btc charts follow S&P w 2 3 wks latency)
