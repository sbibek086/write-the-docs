Now I have User-A group for above-mentioned Customer 

n Manager for above-mentioned Admin{as Admin name is coined for admin-dashboard-one aka superuser} 

n Manager is in User-B group

User-A and User-B group is created after login w root 3w!8 in localhost:8000/admin

for localhost:8000/admin to open-up, I had to docker-exec -it VivekProject2_web_1 <which_is_container_name> python manage.py createsuperuser

resuming after sorting out brain fog caused by views:

how stupid of me to think that manage_views ka action jastai purchase, order sabai eutai function ma rakhnu parchh vanne soch - that soch was wrong. 
MAILE SOCHE KI tee sabai manager dashboard ma aauni bhaye pachhi views.py ko eutai def bhitra hunuparchh , jun sochnu galat thyo.

views.py le {esko namai sundaa views ma sangai dekhini eutai views ko def ma ta hunuparchh ni vanne sochinchha tara tesari sochnu galat galat sochai thyo }
views.py bhanya ta kasari process garni, tyo logic matra hunchha ni.

RP le ta jhan order ko, cart ko aadi ko foler nai alag alag banayera pratek folder vitra each set of views.py, models.py, forms.py banako chh, which is infact WISER, n which malai lagchh onion architecture bhitra parchh but I'm nt sure
