By default, Django looks for templates in several predefined locations:

1. App-specific templates:  Django automatically looks for templates in a subdirectory named templates within each app's directory.
eg, if our app is called blog, we would place our templates under:
```
myproject/
    blog/
        templates/
            blog/
                our_template.html
```
Each app in our project can have its own templates folder. This allows us to keep app-specific templates separate from templates used across the entire project.

2. Project-level templates: Django also looks for templates in directories listed in the DIRS option of the TEMPLATES setting in settings.py.
```
myproject/
    templates/
        base.html
        navbar.html
        footer.html
```
Note: The search order matters. Django will use the first matching template it finds.
