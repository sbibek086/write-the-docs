Continuous.Integration/Continuous.Deployment aka devOps:

![gitActions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11883023/120933150-82a62080-c718-11eb-9667-0ede1aad1b33.jpg)

there can be 1000+ contributors on one project as it grows big. 
So, its practically impossible to accept every pull req. (PR) code, edit with issues , check its validity(TEST), merge it etc etc. as written by Merged Code, Test, Build, Deploy in above pic. Every incoming PR to your open source repo is called EVENTS and things you do in its response (Mer., T, B, D is act of Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment = CI/CD) is called ACTIONS, which can be automated. Hence, the name Actions with CI/CD pipeline, altho ci cd is superset of action.

cicd pipeline:

1. Merge code by git --2.Test -- 3. Build -- 4.Deploy (I can do it thru. XAMPP to localhost but other ways too) _{amateur me understood, deploy to server is always thru xampp, which is true for php dev. But it can be facilitated entirely from packages which in turn is called by terminal scripts. Eg. Xxxxxx in create-react-app}_
 
  5.  Then I will push to repo

These all can be automated writing few lines code in .yml

Mind you! Github Actions run on github server itself.

But why is docker-compose.yml (can be said more Infrastructure as code) more seeked n practical efficient than docker way
