kernel is middle tier which connects to hw resources. kernel doesnt always have to be terminal or bash CLI stuffs. It can be GUI (thanks to Linus who must have painstakingly written all those lines which lets you control w mouse). all those linux cmds like sudo, apt all these are recognized because Linus had written defined it as packages in C and assembly lang while writing Linux kernel. btw he didnt write it from scratch tho. he wrote on top of GNU framework, which was revolution against all proprietary locked Unix.

As opposite, windows we see cant be said kernel. its OS. (idk what qualifies for kernel n what for OS, n idc ) (Linux is both kernel and OS). Windows is for handicapped layman, i breathe it

So, one thing I appreciate about Linux is: its file systems and naming, folder organization are implicitly such that what developers had to explicitly do while developing in IDE.
Like in Linux, they say mounting while we are connecting to USB stick. Mounting is exactly dev language. Like we say MOUNT pgm output to say some docker container url.
All engines are opened in Linux. also, IAM are ditto same like they say root folder root user etc same as when we are doing DB or aws IAM.
there's no drives label in Linux :)

Linux is GPL-3 license(all is free as air): you dont need to install in linux, you just need to connect ,same like you get all nodejs packages when you terminal cmd 'npm install' in say windows.

idk if I have time to catch up linux but atleast i will try to collect tids and bits here n there i have pinned bookmarked half-read ,n try to integrate understandg.
