restart runtime message reading:
there might be dependency conflict <- sthg like that message 
when I try to run
import cudf
codeblock confused killed me about from where to restart runtime to clean slate n then again-put local variables.

It turns out I dont have to restart all the way from 

apt-get update

apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

but JUST RESTART

pip install cudf-cu11 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com wala cell

lets understand why exactly that dependency conflict came?

So, apt-get update updates package list in my colab VM by fetching latest version of package list from repo n updates also local package cache.

n

apt ... cuda toolkit installs nvidia CUDA toolkit, which provides development env (dev env includes GPU accel libraries, compiler for nvidia gpu n runtime libraries) for creating high performance GPU accelerated applications.

Mind u that CUDA is parallel computing platform n programming model developed by nvidia, which allows developers to use nvidia gpu for general-purpose processing, enabling high-performance computing applications.
CUDA provides
-tools, 

-libraries (such as cuBLAS n cuFastFourierT to achieve high performance on gpu operations. n cuBLAS cuFFT libs are used by open source libs like cuPy in replacement for PyPI's NumPy), 

-runtime environment for executing programs on nvidia gpu. 

Long story short: CUDA serves as foundational framework that enables both cuPy and cuDF to leverage the computational power of NVIDIA GPUs.
Without CUDA, these libraries would not be able to execute operations on GPUs.
cuPy and cuDF are complementary in the sense that cuPy is advanced gpu-compatible cousin library to NumPy, n cuDataFrame to pandas. 

---
So, it must have been that when I was running 

pip install cudf-cu11 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com wala cell,

it must have been disturbed by packages or variables just-before-installed-by apt-get update 
n apt .. toolkit wala cell block

because similar packages n vars we are trying to install but specifically from cudf-cu11, so it is begging, "Restart session means Just rerun only this cell, IDIOT n not from the beginning"
Primer is on my blog: What does restart session n again running certain cell do on memory clearance n library re initialization, when to do it n why its necessary

After above problem is solved, again this problem

Compiler messages and their meanings explained:

pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

means

this error means that when pip is installing or upgrading a package, it may not fully consider the versions of already installed packages. This can lead to version conflicts or the installation of incompatible versions, as pip doesn't re-evaluate all dependencies of all installed packages during this process.

The following packages were previously imported in this runtime:
  [cuda]

means

the listed packages, in this case, "cuda," have already been imported or loaded into the current runtime environment. This might indicate that runtime environment has preloaded these packages, potentially affecting subsequent operations or dependencies that rely on them.

how not getting driver runtime matching mess things up?
