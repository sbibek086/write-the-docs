-IsFormalEduNecessary?-  NOOO. Coming after Kishore kumar live singing bbc ONLY WHICH I WATCH, {coz singer bannu sannu xaina} but still what a phenom. I observed that altho he had no formal education in singing, why he exceled? Its because - lot of times, formal education framework has unnecessarily elements taught, so much elements which are not organs to actual components of WHAT MAKES THINGS WORK, but are just there for academic inheritance and passing of knowledge bodies. For eg, I got ielts R 9 once I dared to quit all Masters in Education Classes and just resort to my intelligence of problem solving. Yes, that simultaneous attack all, I didnt learn from another but came up on my own. So, extrapolating similar reasoning, Kishore Da tho didnt formally train, he accumulated all those playback singing element - doing justice to words from soul, at same time justifying each music beat - all integrating- LETS NOT FORGET, he justifies each word from soul, adjust every word rhyme pitch etc in accordance to each beat. No unnecessary element forced upon as academic formal educationality ,and it fact it gave room for his brain understanding observation to other subtle elements like pumping soul to every words beat. So, didnt he have fundamental of lyrics structure, didnt he have fundamental of music octave structure? of course, he had from hither tither guidance mentoring from 'O nadi re' singer guru BUT EDGE FACTOR he could understand - that singing from soul justifying beats words, which formal trained werent trained - THAAT he infused from common sense observation standing on solid fundamentals. BUT I had none to be playback singing but I will integrate similarly on acting and writing JUST like sylvester did {even SLY had no formal university training on script writing!} those who do not understand all those INSIDE INTRICACIES but just feel difference in output, they call it MAGIC done by MAGICIAN.

Art of BigMoneyPulling Negotiation- 10 lakh chahinxa vane 1crore bata deal suru gar: also susma karki le kina dhaak lauxe ta lakh ko shopping ko, ta ki 40,000 vaye ni pay garxa ni t uslai :: BIG MONY kunai euta garera fodna sakiyo vane arko ta xod de na, mero dimaag dahi vaaxa eso garera, I have to leave one.


 BLACK-MAGIC sureshot success mindset:

Getting inspired from right person is always good but there is a thin line. When we get inspired too much, rather than focusing on ourselves on own challenges, we have background focus on them not own. and the moment that background becomes dominant on ourselves and challenges we are solving, we mess up. It should always be-we and problems tasks we are doing.

- I have observed people on another level- their view of life -world in general- their leisure, religion, passion etc are different from rest 90%- their view is integrated. So, from that integrated understanding n viewpoint, they r just doing right thng acc to right time. They dont think of work as work n play as play. They dont have to- for them, its all chad living.
- Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom. Given 10% chaance of 100x ROI, just take that bet.

MY THINKING FAULT ya chh:
kunai kura hudaina vani dekhi sakdaa pani tyehi kuraa hos vanera lide dhippi kasiranu, tyo bigreko wa sochya na vayeko kuraa bata aghi badna na saknu, eg, bishnu subba films bandaina vanne tha vai sakdaa pani 'kaile shootng hunxa' vanera lide dhippi kasiranu, instead I could have just move on, admitting I was fooled

- kaako camper van herya, tractor herna

- laalach ma fasxu ma 
for eg. , ASIK UPERKOTI le thul thulo kura- malai conssultancy le md banayo yo garyo u garyo vanera , maile es bata kaam lina saki halxu kaam lagne manxe ho vanera fokat ma 2000 ko khuwaye- tyo ni u le aaja party ho ki kya ho, etti vanera uksako adhaar ma
for eg., BABA le ma esto ma usto maile etti lagani garexu vandai ma laalach ma parera maile es bata kaam lina sakxu vanera maile 28000 diye
- little same w MAHES too
DOOOOOONT laalach ma fasera aile ko sun arka lai na de vivek

- Nabin dahal le bhanya jasto kaa tyo talcha kate ta vaihalthyo ni, kata ko chaabi ko naksa pathayera katera garna khojya NAATAK 

m ali badhi wolf-present at moment ma xu, so I success at intense-at-moment performance but fail at long term planning.

mero tyo ARU KO PAXI lagni baani hataunai parxa ani khoi ta MailaBa le jasto maalik jasari sochna sakeko.

RELATIONSHIP
if I have to sugarcoat relationship eg when I have to talk or m talking, then it is just indirect hint that that relationship is bitter one surface scratch below. DONT STAND ON SUCH thin ice relation, I can plunge down on its bitter below anytime. - BEWARE OF all red flags when entering relationship- dont CONSIDER IT ok etti ko red flag kehi ni hudaina vanera, cut silently. 

Just focus on one good xxx 1on1 movie hernai pare, dont watch jpt, naak kaan le khaako video herxas ra, sex pani ta euta limit ma maryadaa ma po hunxa ta
