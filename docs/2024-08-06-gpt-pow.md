Trying hard to be PyGot, who talks n updates w Py like its second nature. But I already am 75-way-there n hoping to full transition soon. idk what it is - is it recoil of just recent close miss-hit w my datascience competition, or is it subscious trauma of recent event, idk what it is. even looking back at recent Datascience code has been like eating that frog, which I should anyway. I think - David Allen's Getting.Things.Done needs serious soul- visit.

Anyway, back to pow-God-mode gpt virtually for everything. 

Uploading code files and letting it analyze has been one.

_oh, btw, ensure that you have one brave incase duckduckgo - default brings up cross origin API error, which simply means 'no access' when trying to attach g drive files. so, I jumped over this duckduck's annoying 'no access' just doing from brave_

_n btw vivek, open one terabox so that my gdrive'ss 15GB is purely for my baby clb's code all over._
