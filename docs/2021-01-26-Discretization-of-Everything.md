One of interesting shift to trends in web3 world is what can be called discretization. I mean each and every things like scaling, DAO, dex, cex, oracle, NFT etc. are now discrete items.

It is like the equivalent of how humans had managed to equilivalent-ify each and every resources like this building costs say 2M worth fiats or this river costs 5M worth etc etc. how this discretization became possible? It became possible after Satoshi showed how value exchange ecosystem could be made with bitcoin discrete units? 

how does this work?

well discrete means it could change hands .hence, we have created breathing cell of economy.
who regulates transfer ledger? miners then delegators+ validators
what ensures they act well and not false? well, stake their same ecosystem coins as deposit ,and penalise them if act false and reward them if honest.
welcome! now we have living breathing chain. SO, how can this specific architecture be versatilized to every imaginable purpose, lets say for oracle. Well, Look at this architecture: https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/videos/what-is-the-graph
