Big- picture of what areas bitcoin spawned other massive cyber take-over
**Cross-road where tech advancement (eg cyberocracy, btc eth, DAO) have come to replace existing society/ nation structures
like banking, obsolete political org, constitution w more naturalway of INT'L RULE ORDER**

In banking crisis of 2008, expectation of regulator on banking industry weren't met,
or in other words expectation of society on regulators.
And in some sort, this is endemic to modern world because power structures in modern world are opaque.

These opaque nature of power structures were fine in pre globalization small small block world.
With aid of globalization and from 90s, ominent internet, we see bigger and bigger power structure,
bigger and bigger corporate structures, multinational corporates.
and these power structures are beginning to become very dangerous problematic simply
because they place too much unchecked power to large extent in the hands of few.

Decentralization is way of ensuring that these unchecked powers dont go unchecked.
It has same check and balances broadly speaking in line with constitution (set of rules of fairness and equity).
Its only by having these check and balances, and rules be transparent, and expecting credible reasonable expectations
be fulfilled new cyberocracy way.

This decentralizaition tech is contributing big part of it,
and is as being cornerstone of maintaining society in rule based international order.

Because World has always favored more to rule based more international order.
 Eg Post world war, we see rise of more kind of international structures like UN etc.
And things are breaking down, rules of game are changing as pre- arrangements couldn't fulfill expectation.

somethings got to give in unless we set up new way of ensuring that internationally on global basis, some rules based order.
I see that decentralization tech community has been rapidly building to it.

Decentralization is going to retain and evolve as more transparency, openness, fair power distribution to masses
and immutability of code are there for all to see.

I go gaga about satoshi here and there often.
Things that I notice, admire and try to embody from him:

1. focus on own circle of control: he created btc leveraging network of machines - internet. I used internet to watch cat vids n tv sitcoms.
2. have big implications of knowledge: he used Poisson equation to calculate possibility of if hacker can do 51% attack on established chain. I understood Poisson equation (which is just special case of Normal distribution) to prepare for certs.
3. blue ocean strategy: I dont need to be one more bidder in already sheep-herded competition. Know where big problem has yet been unsolved - very few have leisure out of race to actually think of it.
4. It would take effort and time to solve problems- big or small. Choose big ones.
5. dont change language for the sake of it. he was using C++ to write all headers, libraries, not even using py. Maybe out of compulsion cause he had to write all libraries, headers as well.
6. Stay low-key: world will ultimately have to come down to whats FUNDAMENTAL. hype is short-term. n other is I, who have to mic post when I solve little hard problem or have little more doh'.
7. Sometimes, you solve problems for betterment of world, not for name-ego. satoshi is anonymous and will forever.
8. whats FUNDAMENTAl? - In my case, today, I dissected X-ray'ed all request and response headers, payloads, inititators etc etc. I went down to the very cells of things- this is what I can make impact on from.
9. Being able to come up w schematics of things n then after coding accordingly is right.
10. Boring is NOT boring- real math equation n real science journal are not blood pumping as Avengers: Infinity but it will be enjoyable, if I understand - whats important. Satoshi bothered to dust away n pick up all 1990s failed b-money papers and continually think study about it for 2 years before he actually begaan coding.
11. He did not look for complicated solutions when simple could do the job, but he also did not avoid them, which really is the correct way of coding, thinking or even living.
12. Dont be versatile for the sake of it or false sense of pride by Wow from others but bother being divergent. in his case, he studied economics too besides programming cause economics is intertwined when one sets to make such economic product.
13. Watching other fairy tale story is just time pass. Put self arse to work n believe me, its enjoyable - knowing what I'm doing has real impact n implication. 
14. leaving code open source leverages community input to code. *tho may unsuitmyprj
15. morphy was relevant in 18th century NOT now. now we have computer n compiler to play
    
One of interesting shift to trends in web3 world is what can be called discretization. I mean each and every things like scaling, DAO, dex, cex, oracle, NFT etc. are now discrete items.
It is like the equivalent of how humans had managed to equilivalent-ify each and every resources like this building costs say 2M worth fiats or this river costs 5M worth etc etc. 

how this discretization became possible? It became possible after Satoshi showed how value exchange ecosystem could be made with bitcoin discrete units ? 
how does this work ?

well, discrete means it could change hands. hence, we have created breathing cell of economy.
Who regulates transfer ledger? miners then delegators+ validators.

What ensures they act well and not false?
- well, stake their same ecosystem coins as deposit ,and penalise them if act false and reward them if honest.

welcome! now we have living breathing chain. SO, how can this specific architecture be versatilized to every imaginable purpose, lets say for oracle. 

Well, Look at [this architecture](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/videos/what-is-the-graph)

After eth took over contracts w auto-enforcing smart contract where code itself is escrow of trust, next is oracle to combine w smart contract
