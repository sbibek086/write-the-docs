Big- picture of what areas bitcoin spawned other massive cyber take-over
**Cross-road where tech advancement (eg cyberocracy, btc eth, DAO) have come to replace existing society/ nation structures
like banking, obsolete political org, constitution w more naturalway of INT'L RULE ORDER**

In banking crisis of 2008, expectation of regulator on banking industry weren't met,
or in other words expectation of society on regulators.
And in some sort, this is endemic to modern world because power structures in modern world are opaque.

These opaque nature of power structures were fine in pre globalization small small block world.
With aid of globalization and from 90s, ominent internet, we see bigger and bigger power structure,
bigger and bigger corporate structures, multinational corporates.
and these power structures are beginning to become very dangerous problematic simply
because they place too much unchecked power to large extent in the hands of few.

Decentralization is way of ensuring that these unchecked powers dont go unchecked.
It has same check and balances broadly speaking in line with constitution (set of rules of fairness and equity).
Its only by having these check and balances, and rules be transparent, and expecting credible reasonable expectations
be fulfilled new cyberocracy way.

This decentralizaition tech is contributing big part of it,
and is as being cornerstone of maintaining society in rule based international order.

Because World has always favored more to rule based more international order.
 Eg Post world war, we see rise of more kind of international structures like UN etc.
And things are breaking down, rules of game are changing as pre- arrangements couldn't fulfill expectation.

somethings got to give in unless we set up new way of ensuring that internationally on global basis, some rules based order.
I see that decentralization tech community has been rapidly building to it.

Decentralization is going to retain and evolve as more transparency, openness, fair power distribution to masses
and immutability of code are there for all to see.

One of interesting shift to trends in web3 world is what can be called discretization. I mean each and every things like scaling, DAO, dex, cex, oracle, NFT etc. are now discrete items.
It is like the equivalent of how humans had managed to equilivalent-ify each and every resources like this building costs say 2M worth fiats or this river costs 5M worth etc etc. 

how this discretization became possible? It became possible after Satoshi showed how value exchange ecosystem could be made with bitcoin discrete units? 
how does this work?

well, discrete means it could change hands. hence, we have created breathing cell of economy.
Who regulates transfer ledger? miners then delegators+ validators.

What ensures they act well and not false?
- well, stake their same ecosystem coins as deposit ,and penalise them if act false and reward them if honest.

welcome! now we have living breathing chain. SO, how can this specific architecture be versatilized to every imaginable purpose, lets say for oracle. 

Well, Look at [this architecture](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/videos/what-is-the-graph)

After eth took over contracts w auto-enforcing smart contract where code itself is escrow of trust, next is oracle to combine w smart contract
