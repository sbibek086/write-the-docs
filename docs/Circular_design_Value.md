Topic: 

Background: So, in order to economic incentivize landlord maintaining disposable water's level entering Great Barrier Reef, Australia's government has introduced Reef Credits. Landlord can earn Reef Credits if they ensure water they dispose to Great Barrier Reef passes clean-level. reef Credit can in turn act as verified reputation of greenliness to the person or corpporate. Reef Credit can be sold online but it can cause serious case of forgery - what if one with lot of money buys Reef Credit without actually committing and putting in practice to its cause.
       Something similar was tried to be implemented in TagMe App, where I worked last year. TagMe tried to convert quantify Tagging Landslide etc by photos and lats longs (in order to prevent anyone would post photoshop images of landslide n earn a lot of Tag Credit), and they would give economic rewards like recharge cards for it.

Another context:
Zero- Knowledge proof is now do-able open source:

btw, ZK is scenario where how do you confirm that A is the person who has no criminal record and A should be the person whose loan should be sanctioned by bank. On the process, not revealing any identity of A. This is a classic problem.

Now, DECO sandbox lets us do it all on Zero-Knowledge but still able to proof it.
