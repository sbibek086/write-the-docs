Preface:

So, I had meticulously assembled all vscode settings and extensions in my 'sbibek086' github, back 3-4 y ago.

When I was hired as IT dev/manager in nearby town, it so happened that I connected my 'AWScommunity' github to gitlab, with all my precious code-contriution sitting in 'AWScommunity' gitlab. So, obviously, I'd like to make my 'AWS..' github my primary default.

So, I had to migrate all my settings from 'sb..' one to 'AWS..' one.

So, 1st, I did export settings n extensions from 'sb..' acc in form of file as below: 

_(needless to say, I logged-in my 'sb..' github-connected-VScode clicking üë§ in bottom-left corner)_

??- does this setting-extension file get saved to my profile-idk, so better I'd just save this file in g-drive.

---
Then, I had to login back to 'AWS..' github-connected-vscode

If we notice in this screenshot, the settings-extensions of any vscode-account, which I open stick as 'Default ‚úîÔ∏è Active' meaning it is sticking to just on my machine n nothing to do w account profile.

Also, if we notice in this screenshot, I can also choose to import just template of settings-extensions readymade-made whether for python or data-science etc. but pity is - I would have to login to new vscode profile but cant merge w my existing vscode profile.

```
So, what is that ideal setting-extension that I want to have in my profile

-  Add plugins for language support, linting, version control, liveserver for httping in browser, 
   blockman(code to rect block) n tabnine.
   
   codeformatter extension formats code. for that, we have to select code n then Rclicking to ..,

-  Configure keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions (e.g., build, run, refactor) to save time.

-  Define and enforce a consistent code style using the IDE's codeFormatter to keep codebase uniform

-  Turn on linting to catch syntax errors, code smells, and style violations early.

-  set up debugging configurations for your environment to facilitate smooth debugging sessions

-  Connect IDE to Git or other version control systems for seamless code mgmt

-  Use snippets n templates to speed up coding common structures and methods

-  Set up build paths, environment variables, and run configurations specific to your projects

-  TURN ON AUTO-SAVE n and configure backups to prevent data loss.

 OF-COURSE, I W'UD SAVE THIS AS vsSETTINGS FILE SOMEWHERE
```

![vs-cmd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04274f7-56e0-4703-8328-762d61a8a070)

do not take headache of relative path lingo, just left click file in vscode n grab ABSOLUTE PATH, NOOOT relative path copy garni, for inserting its url wherever u need.

in vscode terminal, Ctrl Shift C V chalchh (windows cmd prompt ma chai ho copy garna lai select garera rigt click garnu parne n NOT ctrl C)

Github POWs:

a) Sub-issues now in Issues:

quoted:  GitHub just shipped the largest set of changes to GitHub Issues. As an Issues power-user this is directly relevant to me.

The big new features are sub-issues, issue types and boolean operators in search.

Sub-issues look to be a more robust formalization of the existing feature where you could create a - [ ] #123 Markdown list of issues in the issue description to relate issue together and track a 3/5 progress bar. There are now explicit buttons for creating a sub-issue and managing the parent relationship of such, and clicking a sub-issue opens it in a side panel on top of the parent.

Issue types took me a moment to track down: it turns out they are an organization level feature, so they won't show up on repos that belong to a specific user.

Organizations can define issue types that will be available across all of their repos. I created a "Research" one to classify research tasks, joining the default task, bug and feature types.

Unlike labels an issue can have just one issue type. You can then search for all issues of a specific type across an entire organization using org:datasette type:"Research" in GitHub search.

The new boolean logic in GitHub search looks like it could be really useful - it includes AND, OR and parenthesis for grouping.

(type:"Bug" AND assignee:octocat) OR (type:"Enhancement" AND assignee:hubot)

b) Github CodeSpaces:

codespace shortcuts: 

Ctr Shift ` for bringing terminal; 

Ctrl shift F for finding code across multiple files in repo. 

my codespace setting loggedIn by my ghub, ie. my codespace settings belong to my github, so if i sync, then its setting is reflected to no matter other newly created codespaces.  

quoted: Idea of using generative AI for autocomplete in a text editor is a really significant innovation, and is still my favorite example of a non-chat UI for interacting with models.

Copilot evolved a lot over the past few years, most notably through the addition of Copilot Chat, a chat interface directly in VS Code. I've only recently started adopting that myself - the ability to add files into the context (a feature that I believe was first shipped by Cursor) means you can ask questions directly of your code. It can also perform prompt-driven rewrites, previewing changes before you click to approve them and apply them to the project.

Today's announcement of a permanent free tier (as opposed to a trial) for anyone with a GitHub account is clearly designed to encourage people to upgrade to a full subscription. Free users get 2,000 code completions and 50 chat messages per month, with the option of switching between GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

I've been using Copilot for free thanks to their open source maintainer program for a while, which is still in effect today:

_People who maintain popular open source projects receive a credit to have 12 months of GitHub Copilot access for free. A maintainer of a popular open source project is defined as someone who has write or admin access to one or more of the most popular open source projects on GitHub. [...] Once awarded, if you are still a maintainer of a popular open source project when your initial 12 months subscription expires then you will be able to renew your subscription for free._

It wasn't instantly obvious to me how to switch models. The option for that is next to the chat input window here, though you may need to enable Sonnet in the Copilot Settings GitHub web UI first:
