Preface:

So, I had meticulously assembled all vscode settings and extensions in my 'sbibek086' github-logIn-vscode, back 3-4 y ago.

When I was hired as IT dev/manager in nearby town, it so happened that I connected my 'AWScommunity' github to gitlab, with all my precious code-contriution sitting in 'AWScommunity' gitlab. So, obviously, I'd like to make my 'AWS..' github my primary default.

So, I had to migrate all my settings from 1st vscode one to later one.

So, 1st, I did export settings n extensions from 'sb..' acc in form of file as below: 

_(needless to say, I logged-in my 'sb..' github-connected-VScode clicking 👤 in bottom-left corner)_

n after it, I had simply saved that settingExtension.file in my g-drive's TechFolder

Then, I had to login back to 'AWS..' github-connected-vscode

If we notice in this screenshot, the settings-extensions of any vscode-account, which I open stick as 'Default ✔️ Active' meaning it is sticking to just on my machine n nothing to do w account profile.

Also, if we notice in this screenshot, I can also choose to import just template of settings-extensions readymade-made whether for python or data-science etc. but pity is - I would have to login to new vscode profile but cant merge w my existing vscode profile.


So, what is that ideal setting-extension that I want to have in my profile

-  Add plugins for language support
   
-  Turn on linting to catch syntax errors, code smells, and style violations early by
 
    1st installing right extension for Your Language --for py, install the Python extension by Microsoft while JS/TS uses the built-in ESLint extension. 

    Then File > Preferences > Settings (Ctrl+,) ; Search: linting ; Toggle "Linting: Enabled" to ON

    Then install Linter Tool (if needed); some extensions require external linter to be installed 

    for eg. for Py, install popular linters by: pip install pylint after which Ctrl+Shift+P → "Python: Select Linter" → Choose pylint 

    Once enabled, any syntax errors or style issues will be underlined in the editor, and shown in the Problems tab (Ctrl+Shift+M).

-  set up debugging configurations for your environment to facilitate smooth debugging sessions

-  Use snippets n templates to speed up coding common structures and methods

-  Set up build paths, environment variables, n run configurations specific to your projects

-  TURN ON AUTO-SAVE n and configure backups to prevent data loss.

 OF-COURSE, I W'UD SAVE THIS AS vsSETTINGS FILE SOMEWHERE

CtrlKEnter to open selected file in VScode in new tab; CtrlShiftV while clicking ReadMe to open it in PreviewHighlight Mode

dont take headache of relative path lingo, just left click file in vscode n grab ABSOLUTE PATH, NOOOT relative path copy garni, for inserting its url wherever u need.

in vscode terminal, Ctrl Shift C V chalchh (windows cmd prompt ma chai ho copy garna lai select garera rigt click garnu parne n NOT ctrl C)
