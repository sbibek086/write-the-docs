Pgm-er habit traits

Compiler Error message are friends, do not be afraid, paranoic -- just read what it is telling, esp the last line. But you do not want compiler message coming up.

You would want the program to run smoothly on one take. In order to be so, you should (at least while programming) have the habit of staying BY THE BOOK within as precisely as possible.

What do I mean by that? look below img:
