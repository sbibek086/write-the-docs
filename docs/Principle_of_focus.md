Focus is important, but if you ignore some problems related to your business early they may come back later and explode in your face creating a lot of collateral damage in the process.

As for the attention seeking media, their product is attention time and should be ignored while active time we have on life ,or say attention energy we have on 12 hr/day is very very scarce resource. As IMPORTANT as it is to have RIGHT priortities, its EVEN IMPORTANT to not be distracted. because even if I have RIGHT priorities, if I get distracted by that, I will give time to that noise. n giving time to noise will not serve my goals.

I remind myself, "Be skeptic. Have default skeptic mask over everything- friendship, new ICO etc, and if certain criterias meet, then only gradually unlock access acceptance gates"- easier said than done.

On humbleness:
I recall back times when I become boastful or proud of myself or pampered from appreciation, I lose ground for my self-evaluation. When I become proudy, I treat reality access as a monologue about my own skills rather than dialogue with reality or nature.
Science, be it IT or any other, is not about us or making our image great. It's about trying to understand world (technology), It's meant to be learning experience where we take calc. risks, make mistakes along way and learn.
So, humbleness is not only for moral show-off and if it's for show-off, we are catching snake at the wrong end but humbleness humility is required for self growth. 

As Feyman says, 'Be teachable, you are not always right. Humility is necessary for self growth'.

As much problem is with illiterates, problem is also that people are educated just enough to believe what they have been taught, what society standards they observe are, and not analytical enough to question anything they have been taught.
Our intelligence is not measured by numbers in certificates. They are many cases just record of our memory abilities. It is defined by our willingness to learn, solve problems, try new things.

I like these quotes:

“You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.”

**"When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn't have to look outside themselves for approval."**

"You have power over your mind— not outside events, which are out of your circle-of-control. Realize this, and you will find strength.” 

“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. There is no such thing as luck.
Fate is the endless chain of causation, whereby things are; the reason or formula by which the world goes on. There is no such thing as fate”

**“Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.” **

“All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride and self-ego.” 

**“It’s not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: what are we busy about?” **

"If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it.”

“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.”

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil.
Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. Deal world the way it is, NOT the way you wish it should be.”

"Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body. It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult."

“No person has the power to have everything they want, but it is in their power not to want what they don’t have, and to cheerfully put to good use what they do have.”

**“How does it help…to make troubles heavier by bemoaning them?”**

“We suffer more in imagination than in reality. Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them.”

“Ignorance is the cause of fear.”

“The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.”

“Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.”

“If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you're needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.”

“Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”

“In your actions, don't procrastinate. In your conversations, don't confuse. In your thoughts, don't wander. In your soul, don't be passive or aggressive. In your life, don't be all about business.”

"Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control."

**“First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. Curb your desire — don’t set your heart on so many things and you will get what you need.”**

"If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid."

“Better to trip with the feet than with the tongue.”

“Nothing is more hostile to a firm grasp on knowledge than self-deception and biased-full-of-fallacies thinking.”

**“Follow where reason leads.”**

"Well-being is realized by small steps, but it is truly no small thing."

"It takes a wise man to discover a wise man.”

“People who talk well but do nothing are like musical instruments; the sound is all they have to offer.
