- Make sure you comply with Nepal's laws and Merolagani's terms & conditions. Automated trading may violate Merolaganiâ€™s Terms of Service. Always check with platform administrators before proceeding.
plus GUI changes may make automation not work

see how manual trading works, where price data is displayed, and how orders are placed.
- **Identify Automatable Actions**: Note any restrictions (like CAPTCHAs, OTPs, manual verifications).

then, Define Your Trading Logic

then

ask (+977) 01-5315101/5315184 If an API is available: Get access (document tokens, endpoints).

If not, Web Scraping (Most Likely)
- **Python libraries**: Use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to collect data.
- **Headless browser**: Use `Selenium` or `Playwright` for interactive/dynamic content.

**Example (Scraping)**:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://merolagani.com/LatestMarket.aspx'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
# Parse tables for stock prices
```

Then, Build AI Agent

- **Model**: Train (or use a pre-built) ML model for trading signals.
- **Implementation**: Use `Python` (`scikit-learn`, `Tensorflow`, `PyTorch`) or rule-based bots.
- **Backtest**: Run your agent on historical Merolagani data.

Then, Automate Order Placement

#### If Merolagani Has API:
- Use API endpoints to place orders programmatically.

#### If NO API (most likely):
- Use browser automation (`Selenium`, `Playwright`) to fill out forms and submit orders.

**Selenium Example:**
```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('https://merolagani.com/')

# Log in
username_input = driver.find_element('id', 'UserName')
password_input = driver.find_element('id', 'Password')
username_input.send_keys('your_username')
password_input.send_keys('your_password')
driver.find_element('id', 'btnLogin').click()

# Navigate to trading section and place order
# ... (identify the correct button/fields using driver.find_element())
```

Then,

- **Monitor trades**: Log every decision and result.
- **Error handling**: If trade fails, send notification/email.
- **Exit strategies**: Include safety stops and checks.

Then,

- **Server/Cloud**: Run on a VPS or local machine (with always-on internet).
- **Scheduler**: Use `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for periodic tasks.
- **Security**: Encrypt credentials. Do NOT share login information!

---

- **CAPTCHA/OTP**: Orders may be blocked by security checks.
- **Logging**: Log every action for audit and debugging.
