same was my limitation on thinking ssh.

attention to each n every detail is vvvimp here- this is reason why largerTimeFrame thinker or OnlyBigPicGuy struggles initially, because we go on life without even thinking about most of activities like walking etc. n since our autopilot mode takes over while coding, our autopilot n brain-conferring-things-quickly tendency dont let see things behind it

for eg. I was just on-fly typing
 python [manage.py](http://manage.py/) makemigration
having never even bothering
is [manage.py](http://manage.py/) even in path that I am bashing on?
-this missing-the-point n just-doing-as-it-is-wout-even-thinking-why is the reason why programming doesnt come as flow to some as to another nerd guy


 n such brain misses intricacies behind it 'cause computer world is nothing like spatial intuiton etc etc like in chess, football etc. Its all about scope of files, purpose of files, correctly referencing files from one location to another, visualizing in cells of things on REST, learning grammar of different context n types files (eg, .config, .js, .py etc has own grammar), n then being able to see connection eg. how [settings.py](http://settings.py/) co ordinate w say .config.

but things become more tempting after this brain rewiring
