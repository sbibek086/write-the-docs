A wheel (.whl) {should follow PEP427 formatting standard} is 

-built-package format for Python that provides a more efficient way to distribute and install Python packages.

- is a binary distribution format for Python packages. It allows for precompiled packages to be installed without the need for building from source.

-is a ZIP archive with a specific structure that contains the package's files, including: Compiled binary files (.so, .dll, .pyd for extension modules); Pure .py files; Metadata files (e.g., METADATA, RECORD, WHEEL)

WHY wheel? Since wheels are precompiled, they can be installed much faster compared to building the package from source. This is especially beneficial for packages with complex build processes or those that require compilation of C/C++ extensions

 Wheels can be platform-specific or universal. Platform-specific wheels are labeled with the platform they are compatible with (e.g., manylinux, win32, macosx). Universal wheels can be used on any platform

 Users do not need to have build tools (like a compiler) installed on their system to install a package from a wheel. This simplifies installation process, particularly for users who are not developers.

Wheels ensure that the same binary package can be installed across different environments, reducing the variability that can arise from building packages on different systems.

To install a wheel file:
pip install somepackage.whl

Creating a Wheel
If you are a package maintainer and want to distribute your package as a wheel, you can create a wheel file using the following commands:

Ensure wheel is installed:
pip install wheel   

Create the wheel:
Navigate to your package directory and run:
python setup.py bdist_wheel

This command will generate a .whl file in the dist directory of your package.
