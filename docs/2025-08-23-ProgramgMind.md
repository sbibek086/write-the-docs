exerpt from Pragmatic Programmer pdf

_Enof wisdom are there not only for programmg but as whole life, so need to watch new Life Wisdom I guess- no OshoStuffs n etc -isms. Vivek, I got work to do- c o d e n NOT keep returning to back-to-square-1-Oh-How-to-code. etc_

As programmer, you are 

-part listener

-part advisor

-part interpreter

-part dictator.

You try to capture elusive (difficult to find, catch, achieve) requirements

& find a way of expressing them so that mere machine can do justice. U have to be able to make machine do so.

-You try to document your work so that others can understand it.

-You try to engineer your work so that others can build on it, that too against ticking of time, you work small miracles everyday.

Not necessary that 1 by-the-book thing as best solution in ur situation. Situation dictates it. You adjust your approach to suit current circumstances. You judge relative importance of all factors affecting project n use ur experience to produce appropriate soln.

You should have broad enough background n experience base to allow u to choose good soln in case that u are now facing.

Your background stems from understanding of basic principles of computer science N your experience comes from wider range of practical subjects. THEORY n PRACTICE combine u to make strong.

Each developer is unique, w individual strengths n weaknessses, preference n dislikes. 

Over time, each will craft his/her own personal environment. That environment will reflect his/ her individuality of solving problems, tools/ approach he uses, just as forcefully as his/her hobbies.

So, way/approach of solving problem is not one - by-the-book kind. However, pragmatism can be best summarized as below traits:

-Early adopter/ fast adopter: U have instinct for tech n techniques, n you love trying things out. When given sthg new, u can grasp it quickly n integrate it w rest of your knowledge.

-Inquisitive (having/ showing interest in learning things after being convinced, ok there's pt. learningn it): U tend to ask questions- 'How did u do that' 'Did you have problems w that library' 'What;s this llm that I've been hearing about' 'How are symbolic links implemented' etc

-Critical Thinker: U rarely take things for granted without getting the facts. I have talked about this Not-Impulsive-But-paying-attention-to-details in 'Cavemen's dilemma' blogpost

-Realistic n resilient: U try to understand udnerlying nature of each problem. This realism orientation gives u good feel of how difficult things are, n how long things will take. Understanding for urself that a process would be difficult gives u stamina to keep at it.

-Jack of all trades, master at one

Care ur craft, think about ur work

--

In order to be pragmatic programmer, u will feel challenged to think about what u're doing while doing it. This isnt one time audit of current practices - it'ss ongoing critical appraisal of every decision u make, everyday n in every development. 

Never run on auto-pilot Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time.

Individual pragmatists, each one in even large teams. One who cuts mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.

Improvement is a continuous ongoing process.
