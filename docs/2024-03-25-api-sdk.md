api basics:

--
in  cli comand,

functionality: sw functionality that solves some purpose

existing entity: cli cmd

consumer: user

--
in API,
 
existing entities: api fns,  better correctly said --interfaces in interface based programming ,

consumer: another aka main program where that API is called ( here consumer is NOT user) 

functionality lies behind this layer ie. functionality happens in library where it is called.

like in from scipy.optimize import linprog(args, args WhatWhatICantRecall) then use it as output = linprog(args, args2Etc) 

where linprog is API whose output, this main pgm is using as consumer but functionality is hardcoded in scipy.optimize library

This above image is schematic diagram. Now below, I convert above schematics to code:
code is now not in project repo- with environments, utils etc properly arranged structure but just as snippets.
