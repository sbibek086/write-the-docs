all banks are broke. because banks have system called fractional reserve banking, means bank can lend money they actually dont have. Its a criminal scandal going on for long. 

n most of problems start from politics and central banks, which are part of same political system. They do counterfeiting- artificial printing of money, jaslai vanna chai quantitative easing bhanxan tara ho chai counterfeiting nai.  if ordinary person counterfeit, would go to 20 yr prison. And yet govt n central banks do it all time.

 central banks repress amount of interest rates raised so we don't have real cost of money n yet we blame retail banks for manipulating libor. Sheer effrontery of this is surprsiign. Its central banks that manipulate I rate, plus underneath all this, we talk about deposit guarantees. So when banks go broke thru own incompetence, taxpayer have to bite up the bullet. Its theft from taxpayer.

How world capitalism works

Car-
_This journal is recollection of how I learnt to car in Brookings,south dakota; swim just to kick start all memory._

OK I am now starting a car. I am driving to drop vikram. I sit on driver seat. Then I put back gear to back car ,as car was parked in back of our apt. 
Then I turn steering right according to my car frontMirror view aligns with the bending now straight to my pov .as soon as wheel turns right,  then I rotate back steering to original 12 position. 

Then road of our alley meets with main road highway - yes, that T junction comes.  I stop my car and as coming traffic is far enough to time allow my car to cross,  I front gear my car.  Then I go ahead ahead.

Then I drive and drive ,and afterawhile of some residential streets and avenues, main junction- yes that + junction comes w SDSUtowerClock-looking-below-us junction.
So I stop my car and as who comes ahead in junction has to make first move. So I wait turn and move.

Then again that right junction (yes that junction where main highway cuts right to road inside SDSU) comes so I turn and then I have to watch my rear mirror inside cab to see if some car is following.  If it's,  then I signal right turn as I have to cross section road to get my turn.  As that leaves,  I return right and again right to park,  to leave vikram.
 So brake Laudaa jahile pani b**b jasari gently thicha leg le as vikram shouted ms.
And BCA in America car.  IE.  Brake clutch accelerator. BCA in Np car too? write after know

Arranging samaan while shifting room has tortured me, u know how many items u have to pack. So, w lesson learnt, Things I buy should follow

- different items sud have cog-fitting principle, like nanglo I buy sud fit as lid to circumference to baata  bought
- baata sud have hooks so that I can tighten rope around it
- bought thing sud be multipurpose like my BELOVED Leatherman
- 3rd floor thap like pichhadi ko handpump gadya bhote le garyo, n farm berna tin lagauna kinna mony bacha

Swim - So, I used to go to swimming hall in SouthDakota University, whenever I have spare time.

Let me remember- my main challenge was keeping body horizontal to water as I always tend to have vertical body stand even in water.

For that, I practised doing horizotal dive as good as I could. So, remember that guy with fish like body from Equador. 

When I was fatigued at half sprint on 250 m  long pool, he would finish one sprint with ease. He would not even break water surface film while I was creatig turbulence like crazy, and I improved bit with pratice.

But my biggest guru was thick moustached 51-55 yr old guy from German descend. He would say and I would try to follow -

 When you are doing swim style as above img,

then when u r frontstroking w ur left hand like duck-paw under water pushing water as much u can back to push u forward - yes ,Newtons 3rd law, idiot vivek, it is time u r breating out with mukh and naak- BRooOOOH out, with BRooOOOH oxygen in immediate next movement pattern.

and same movement this time w alternate other side body parts - right hand, head tilted other way etc

My biggest challenge was - when I paddle my foot in up down movement, my hands would also tend to do so. Hard was it to change it. tho I slowly improved.
