Dimensional reduction 

![image](https://github.com/sbibek086/write-the-docs/assets/11883023/6d1f50dd-88a2-459b-8c72-5f0b83485ba1)

Now, in above image last, I ask- what might be that PCA component1 or component2 in X or Y axis respectively?

That is covariance matrix elements.

So, how do we decide which is principal component1 and which is principal component2?

It is by:

euclidian vanya tye shortest distance ho 

Hopefully, no math headache, code as below, however math process bujheko ramro

So, here, we see visually how pca reduces data. NOTE: dimensional redn is not cols reduction, which I thought

teso vaye, ya ta principal component1 matra dekhax, feri stratum ko ma ta diuta PCA banayera khichirathyo. correct fix my this understandg loophole

_PS: Heatmaps, t-SNE Plots, Multi-dimensional Scaling are just alternatives to Dimensional Reduction method
