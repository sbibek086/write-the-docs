all banks are broke. because banks have system called fractional reserve banking, means bank can lend money they actually dont have. Its a criminal scandal going on for long. 

n most of problems start from politics and central banks, which are part of same political system. They do counterfeiting- artificial printing of money, jaslai vanna chai quantitative easing bhanxan tara ho chai counterfeiting nai.  if ordinary person counterfeit, would go to 20 yr prison. And yet govt n central banks do it all time.

 central banks repress amount of interest rates raised so we don't have real cost of money n yet we blame retail banks for manipulating libor. Sheer effrontery of this is surprsiign. Its central banks that manipulate I rate, plus underneath all this, we talk about deposit guarantees. So when banks go broke thru own incompetence, taxpayer have to bite up the bullet. Its theft from taxpayer.

How world capitalism works
