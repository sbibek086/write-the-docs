Tho cheat sheet concise to-knows, but again cheatsheet unnecessarily overwhelms. why would cheatsheet be needed btw when methods infos are just Ctrl+Space click away in VScode. n some codewithHarry vids are unnecessary imo.

Do it as religion & dont feel lazy to note (rough pen notes if hurry or fatigued) all lessons learnt, mistakes made, corrections- all when I solve some pgm challenge. This note will save me tons of time when I face similar situation challenges in future.

so, it doesnt always have to be npm docker pip that we install globally on computer.
it can be VivekAwesomePkgs or even ElasticSearchPkgs- why not ?
One of the whole OSS enthusiasm is also about bringing up with new elegant packages.
btw, novice download softwares, or use SaaS. CHADS just install new packages from terminal n use it in VScode. they are equivalent but latter is more efficient as its not lame GUI bounded.
I remember why Brad Traversy just install new pkgs in terminal. and his Equivalent to Windowers Start menu was just terminal with customised pow commands.
it was roughly like :

BradsAwesomePkgs run Open6TabsAtOnce or BradsAwesomePkgs start Antivirus

similar to we do:

npm install -g AwesomeNPMpkgs   or  npm start server

or  curl whatWhat whatwhat  or gweth (btw it's ethereumPackages) createWallet

or  pip(btw it's Python's) install whatwhat

hmmmmmmmmm, ok
