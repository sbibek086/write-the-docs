This post is currently not perfectly cooked and I will prepare it.

Here, I will explore explored-by-few territories of google account: google adwords, google play, security and settings, and account syncing across multiple devices.

Google is master at keeping and making things simple. But why it has to be complicated in managing all these features like syncing , making multiple profiles within same features like we can do multiple profiles in one google adwords account?
Google is not to blame, we are to. Suppose we make different personal gmail, office gmails etc.

Below, I will break down and try to make sense of overall integration and right TO-DOS and TO-DONTS.

I used to wonder -what is 'this entire 350$ payment threshold available' in ads.google.com aka google adwords. 
I used to wonder - Will I be offered 350$ free advertising?
It turned out, Its not free advertising of any amount. 
I have to pay the amount of money I spend on my advertising.
Its just that My threshold is 350$ means I wont be charged or billed until I spend that amount in that billing cycle.
That brings me to - what exactly is Billing Cycle?
