Here, I will explore explored-by-few territories of google account: google adwords, google play, security and settings, and account syncing across multiple devices.

Google is master at keeping and making things simple. But why it has to be complicated in managing all these features like syncing , making multiple profiles within same features like we can do multiple profiles in one google adwords account?
Google is not to blame, we are to. Suppose we make different personal gmail, office gmails etc.

Below, I will break down and try to make sense of overall integration and right TO-DOS and TO-DONTS.

Google Adwords ads.google.com Billing Cycle, THreshold etc explained:

[Excerpt and credits Source but dont look at it, below is its simplified form](https://www.prospectgenius.com/blog/google-adwords-billing/)

For that its summarized as below:

**“Daily” Budget Is Not What It Seems**

  When you first set up AdWords, Google allows you to set a daily budget.This is NOT the amount AdWords will spend on their ads each day. 

Instead, Google takes the amount you set for your daily budget and multiplies that number by 30.4. The result is what Google allows itself to spend on your ads for the whole month. So, in effect, when you set a daily budget, you’re really setting a *monthly* budget.

---
**Why does Google use your budget this way?**
  Because Google can’t 100% predict how much clicks will cost on a daily basis due to the way AdWords bidding works. Thus, it needs to allow for wiggle room in what it spends from day to day. That’s why Google allows itself to increase spending (up to 2 times your daily budget) on any given day, as long as it decreases spending accordingly on other days so that your monthly total evens out in the end. 
  
  Google needs this wiggle room because not every day of the week is equal in terms of user behavior. For instance, an ad for something like roof repair is likely to receive more clicks on a weekday than a weekend. This means bids for clicks on certain weekdays will be more expensive because they’re more in demand. Knowing this, Google will loosen the reins on your budget in order to spend more in bids and clicks during the week, and then tighten up on the weekend when your ad isn’t seeing as much action. 
  
  In fairness to Google, this strategy does make sense once you understand what it is. However, it also makes your AdWords charges super complicated. There’s an upside to all this confusion, though. The longer you continue on the same daily budget for the same ad campaign, the more effectively Google will spend your budget. As time goes on, Google will collect enough data to learn the optimal days and times for your ad’s performance, so it won’t have to “guess” your budget on a daily basis. All you have to do is stick with it.

**Thresholds and Billing Cycles**
In this context, charging and billing are two separate things. Your charges are what your account has spent on clicks and bids. Your bill, on the other hand, is what Google debits from your credit card. Contrary to most other services you pay for in your normal life, Google doesn’t bill you for your total charges at the end of the calendar month. Instead, it goes by a 30-day billing cycle and bills you every time you hit a certain charge “threshold.” So, you may rack up $670 in charges in the month of January; however, that won’t be reflected in your bill.

**Here’s how Google AdWords billing thresholds work: **

Where I went wrong not understanding this??
![Untitledgggggg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11883023/152497103-33b8f770-790d-40aa-9445-5e35788ece6f.png)

I used to wonder -what is 'this entire 350$ payment threshold. I used to wonder - Will I be offered 350$ free advertising?

It turned out, Its not free advertising of any amount. I have to pay the amount of money I spend on my advertising.
Its just that My threshold is 350$ means I wont be charged or billed until I spend that amount in that billing cycle.

I went wrong firstly I didnt understand I was agreeing my cr card to pay not 5$ * 3 days because I intended that Ed-mark promoted V to run for 3days BUT INSTEAD FOR 5 * 30=150$.  

Either it stopped at 47.89$ at March and 14.xx$ at April because I removed this campaign or it crossed TH and it didnt find that amount in my bank (I dont put my fund in banks) and this all campaign dropped down to 50$ TH , as I am seeing now in my G0ads acc.

**What If You Don’t Want to Pay More Than “X” Amount Each Month?**
One obstacle many businesses face is the fact that they have their own monthly budgets in the real world, outside of AdWords. Often, they don’t want to be billed beyond a certain amount in the same calendar month for fiscal reasons. When this is the case, you have to manually pause your campaign as soon as you reach your limit. Otherwise, your charges will continue to accumulate and you might be billed again at the next threshold. 

If Prospect Genius ((888) 488-9011) is managing your account, we are happy to do this on your behalf. We closely monitor all of the accounts we run, so we will watch your spending and pause your campaign as soon as it gets too close to your personal limit. Then, we’ll resume your campaign once the billing cycle resets. Google AdWords billing is extremely difficult to understand, and that’s probably not an accident.
