I used to think that people who were featured in Times Magazine; they must have been borne with 32 lakshhyan Gun. They must have gone to the best prep schools, A plus plus college and schools, got all the answers right on test. 

But after looking at Stallone _(there are other notable about 5 people globe-across time-across to me but he has been the most influential but being COPYCAT, never in this world but inspiration is a good thing, everybody has somebody to look upto!)_, vertically and horizontally studying him, his bio, his 80s interview-- what drove him to astounding success even with his slurry eyes and right-paralyzed face is the man of remarkable willingness to learn and think independent of the crowds. 

He wasnt born great; he had lots of weakness and a disastrous condition of family he was raised BUT he became great by looking at his mistakes and weaknesses and how to get around them.     

There's a strong-solid mentorship saying that, "Winners were just beginners and in many cases, sub-levelled but what made them distinct is their daringness to just focus on their own process. IT IS THE LOSERS who focus on winners". They make the most of the process of  encountering reality, ESPECIALLY the painful most-burning and most-hurting ones, learn the most and get ahead look ahead. 

And I learned that ONLY they are the ones whom I would want to listen to, hang around to, no matter virtually or by any medium. 

In short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about self mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid rate of improvement and movement toward what I intrinsically wanted in life. 

While this approach worked great for me, I found it more opposite than similar to most others’ approaches, which has produced communications challenges.

Specifically, I found that: 

While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.

While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.

While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them. 

While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting them stand in your way. 

While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.
