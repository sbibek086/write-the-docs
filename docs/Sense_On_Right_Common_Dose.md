Surprisingly, Shaq has been my lazy-goto person for refering what [street smart investing](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fJgVmJFX9CE) is about.

For to be smart street, you have to be double smart than academic street. 

Only caveat is: you dont know how to define it by words as do academic egg-heads and/or book-carrying nerds do but we know it from intuition.
And that intuition is built from observing A+ people in their A+ game. 

Do you think that we spend time watching every other soap operas or trends or what Shahrukh wife told on f**king Kapil Sharma show? 
Nope. Thats none our business.

We would rather sleep, chill on nature walk or just study whats useful to selves.
We are different breeds. I will tell you.

I have been criticized for not being smart enough to be one niche specific. I mean I am a) writing  masterpiece literature {_updated in May 4, I flushed this literature bullshit down my toilet as it didnt return me fund in deep personal critical moment, which I do not want to talk more_} b) investing, c) learning devs as part of my IT job and d) going depth about how Ethereum VM is built from scratch.

And my critics are right - sometimes it feels from brain overload I feel sometimes. I think I will drop that d) stuffs coz for investing, I dont need to have that zero feet view but sometimes curiosity cat itches but I will drop it anyway.

To quote AB, (I am not referring BachPAAn guy who disllusions people w bullshit quiz knowledge, that does nobody no good n continues to fuck people, u idiot! )

"People that are extremely successful don’t learn/study more than others.  They DO more, then when they hit a cap in the DOING up the goal. They then strategically learn exactly (and as little as) what is needed and then return to aggressive doing.

Most learn with no intent. Don’t."
