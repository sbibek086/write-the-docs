Surprisingly, Shaq has been my lazy-goto person for refering what [street smart investing](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fJgVmJFX9CE) is about.

For to be smart street, you have to be double smart than academic street. Only caveat is: you dont know how to define it by words as do academic egg-heads and/or book-carrying nerds do but we know it from intuition.
And that intuition is built from observing A+ people in their A+ game. 
Do you think that we spend time watching every other soap operas or trends or what Shahrukh wife told on f**king Kapil Sharma show? 
Nope. Thats none our business.
We would rather ang out on clubs metting hots, chill on nature walk or just study whats useful to selves.
We are different breeds. I will tell you.
