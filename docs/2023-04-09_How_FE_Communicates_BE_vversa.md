Nightmare of Cross.Origin.Resource.Sharing (blocked) error:

Why Does CORS Error Occur?
When you make a POST request to http://localhost:5000/api/add with a Content-Type header set to application/json, the browser performs a CORS preflight request before making the actual POST request.

Preflight Request is an OPTIONS request sent by the browser to the server to check if the actual request is allowed. 
It ensures: HTTP method (POST, PUT, etc.) is permitted.
The headers (e.g., Content-Type) used in the request are allowed.

In your case:
The browser sends an OPTIONS request to http://localhost:5000/api/add.
The server responds to this OPTIONS request.
If the response does not include the Content-Type header in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response, the browser blocks the actual request.
The error "Request header field Content-Type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response" occurs because the server's CORS configuration does not explicitly permit the Content-Type header in its response to the preflight OPTIONS request.

---Breaking Down the Error---
Request Header Field: The header being sent by your frontend. In this case, it's Content-Type: application/json.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: A response header from the backend server indicating which request headers are allowed. If Content-Type is missing here, the browser will block the request.

---How to Fix It?---
You need to update your backend to explicitly allow the Content-Type header in its CORS configuration.

For Flask:
pip install flask-cors

in bash if you haven't already:

--Update your Flask app---
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}}, headers=["Content-Type"])

@app.route('/api/add', methods=['POST'])
def add():
    data = request.get_json()  # Parse incoming JSON data
    if not data or 'username' not in data:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid data"}), 400
    username = data['username']
    # Process data (e.g., save to database)
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "username": username}), 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```
Explanation:
CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}}, headers=["Content-Type"]) enables CORS for all routes (/*) and allows the Content-Type header.

in console, Network is where we can see which url is requested when we click Action button. So, as we can see in blue color, when we click 'Forgot Pw' button, that url is triggered as seen in RHS network tab. 

and in LHS, we can see what to response with when {certain URL is called} aka {API endpoint}. So, LHS here is backend API docs built in Django by Backend-ers

.env folder lets you default-ize what path we want our tail URL to append with base path URL. That base path url is menioned in .env folder.
.env may have more things than just base path urls. 

Not only this, .env folder has other purposes too, as clarified from below

_Also, we have to do git pull everytime after we do git checkout branchNewlyDevelopedFeature because I remember that one day, I couldnt deploy correctly because my to-go-and-deploy 
branchNewlyDevelopedFeature should have had .env updated._

```
dyk that .gitignore - whatever we put in it, is ignored by git. 
They are not put in burden to git by git. 
Such folders we want to put in .gitignore could be packages, 
which are installed on press of npm install etc.

git fetch --all fetches or pulls updates not only from current branch 
but from all branches in that repo.
```

.eslint.config.json - whatever stds we set for linting has to be followed as protocol in order to be valid. eg. if 'feat' is in eslint.config.json, then our git cmd should obey that language protocol like _git commit  -m "feat: feature of drop down menu fixed in this Pull Req"_ otherwise, compiler wont compile this git

.prettier.config.json - same context as .eslint but here it's to standardize beauty aesthetics of code, that coder should follow - like how much spaces betn two codeblocks.

dyk that Fe developers that among breakpoints like that of tablet, mobile, computer screen, React's minimum query only mentions css and flex specifics for <= minimum pixel width. Above pixel width has default css and flex design. this para deserves another post soon on Fe which I had been preparing
