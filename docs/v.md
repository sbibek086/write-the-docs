Contlict resolution is one of the biggest soft life skills I realized. In a small world where one has to co-exist with people of different ideologies, nature aka personalities, different horoscopes, realizing potential-to-come conflict early on, and doing something about it --either defuse it or just walk away without letting other know that you walk away is tricky but damn necessary so that such situations wont come when almost headaches come in the morning when one realizes that one has to meet the other, and there can be nothing done to avoid it. Infact this is the dilemma when anything you do - either meet that person or not, will just make relationship sour to one next level.
