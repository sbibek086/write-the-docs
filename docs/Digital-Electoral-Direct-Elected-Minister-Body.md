From among my long-time readerbase, one who was not interested in revealing his/her identity had sent me below 'Constitution Draft'. 

Although I am not from law background student, I find the design in laws pragmatic in Nepal though I believe this draft can be iterated upon with careful precision and collective conscience, and legislation and judiciary system be extended upon from this draft. 

It is viewable [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-vOAxqSY-0pe0xNbQd3WSyIAvZ324JX/view?usp=sharing) .

Its shortcut link is bit.ly/genz9
