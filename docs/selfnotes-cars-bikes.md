Car-
_This journal is recollection of how I learnt to car in Brookings,south dakota; swim just to kick start all memory._

OK I am now starting a car. I am driving to drop vikram. I sit on driver seat. Then I put back gear to back car ,as car was parked in back of our apt. 
Then I turn steering right according to my car frontMirror view aligns with the bending now straight to my pov .as soon as wheel turns right,  then I rotate back steering to original 12 position. 

Then road of our alley meets with main road highway - yes, that T junction comes.  I stop my car and as coming traffic is far enough to time allow my car to cross,  I front gear my car.  Then I go ahead ahead.

Then I drive and drive ,and afterawhile of some residential streets and avenues, main junction- yes that + junction comes w SDSUtowerClock-looking-below-us junction.
So I stop my car and as who comes ahead in junction has to make first move. So I wait turn and move.

Then again that right junction (yes that junction where main highway cuts right to road inside SDSU) comes so I turn and then I have to watch my rear mirror inside cab to see if some car is following.  If it's,  then I signal right turn as I have to cross section road to get my turn.  As that leaves,  I return right and again right to park,  to leave vikram.
 So brake Laudaa jahile pani b**b jasari gently thicha leg le as vikram shouted ms.

PowMinimalism -
I am not that extreme crazy minimalist or any cult-ist but I am simplifying.

some agri tools like hammer, kodalo etc for my farm.

Strong regret on Why I not bought Dish Antenna type Internet connection ,and have to buy wires, connect it again again when I change rooms. Do Dish Type Internet, vivek.

Swim - So, I used to go to swimming hall in SouthDakota University, whenever I have spare time.

Let me remember- my main challenge was keeping body horizontal to water as I always tend to have vertical body stand even in water.

For that, I practised doing horizotal dive as good as I could. So, remember that guy with fish like body from Equador. 

When I was fatigued at half sprint on 250 m  long pool, he would finish one sprint with ease. He would not even break water surface film while I was creatig turbulence like crazy, and I improved bit with pratice.

But my biggest guru was thick moustached 51-55 yr old guy from German descend. He would say and I would try to follow -

 When you are doing swim style as above img,

then when u r frontstroking w ur left hand like duck-paw under water pushing water as much u can back to push u forward - yes ,Newtons 3rd law, idiot vivek, it is time u r breating out with mukh and naak- BRooOOOH out, with BRooOOOH oxygen in immediate next movement pattern.

and same movement this time w alternate other side body parts - right hand, head tilted other way etc

My biggest challenge was - when I paddle my foot in up down movement, my hands would also tend to do so. Hard was it to change it. tho I slowly improved.
