This journal is recollection of how I learnt to car in Brookings,south dakota; swim just to kick start all memory.

Car-OK I am now starting a car. I am driving to drop vikram. I sit on driver seat. Then I put back gear to back car ,as car was parked in back of our apt. 
Then I turn steering right according to my car front view aligns with the bending now straight to my pov .as soon as wheel turns right,  then I rotate back steering to original 12 position. 

Then road of our alley meets with main road highway - yes, that T junction comes.  I stop my car and as coming traffic is far enough to time allow my car to cross,  I front gear my car.  Then I go ahead ahead.

Then I drive and drive ,and afterawhile of some residential streets and avenues, main junction- yes that + junction comes w SDSUtowerClock-looking-below-us junction.
So I stop my car and as who comes ahead in junction has to make first move. So I wait turn and move.

Then again that right junction (yes that junction where main highway cuts right to road inside SDSU) comes so I turn and then I have to watch my rear mirror inside cab to see if some car is following.  If it's,  then I signal right turn as I have to cross section road to get my turn.  As that leaves,  I return right and again right to park,  to leave vikram.
