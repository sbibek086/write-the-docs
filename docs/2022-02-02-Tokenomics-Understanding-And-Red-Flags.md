So, why is tokenomics important? https://cvj.ch/en/education/basics/the-importance-of-tokenomics/

Let's start one story: Alex makes 40000 unique non depleting things.  Releases only 4000 of it in free market at 20$ price.  Turns out- that unique thing proves useful day to day and hence mass adopted.  
  If even shit things can pick up in price by hyping,  then useful things will def pick up in price. So,  that thing price picks up in free market to 60rs. 
 Alex looks at it,  sees 200 percent profit, ie. 40$*36000 (he has that thing locked with him) is good money for him,  so exits all bags at 60rs good or bad his intentions maybe. Obviously bear strength becomes humongous and price dumps like crazy to say 35. 
Retailer who entered at say 40+ are below water. 
What went wrong with those retailers?  They never saw 36000 was in single hand by birth.

So In clover finance,  fully diluted mc=350m n mc=42m. Significant portion is not in free market but few hands, inside hands that can be dumped. By birth,  they can be VC and that too,  they are too powerful.   That's red flag so.

In moonriver,  literally everything was given to free community.  It can't never dump.  Same with btc.  It's price surge is different science though.
