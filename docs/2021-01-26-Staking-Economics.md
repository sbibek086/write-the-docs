https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUpThQP0QV8 description got vital link https://www.mangoresearch.co/blockchain-consensus-vs.../ which clarifies that (Ctrl+F) - Validators comprise primarily of miners and mining pools that run full nodes.
now, Vitalik in 2:02 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izzMuxD4OAM says a)STAKING: as blockchain being secured by large computers running very expensive computation 24/7 (VB is talking about running full node), instead you use coins inside system as basis for system security, so people who have coins can participate as validator ,and doing so, you can have chain come to consensus cheaper. b) Then Vitalik Buterin says: in SHARDING upgrade, each validator in consensus only needs to verify small portion of all of transactions(which is of course latest txs, you dont need to verify from block 0- genesis block) instead of where every computer in network has to process every single transaction ,and doing so , it increases scalability of blockchain and scalabilty of network is also much higher than scalablity of single computer ; co-ordinated task doing much efficient than single doing effect
a) definitely has ans. to my very old question of : If so, new coins are created as reward just from minimum staking. What then prevents price from inflation as economics 1st principle is, more supply means less price provided demand is constant. Is it just demand consistent increase to offset this 1st principle effect. Something more circular ecosystem must be brewing on, As was explained by Karl Floresch in optimistic rollup. Ps: its applicable not only in eth but this inflation prevention has been going on in bitcoin and must be in other blockchain since yrs. Quarterly burning of BNB coin has been practiced in binance to offset this inflation effect but I haven't heard such thing in eth bitcoin, Then what it is.
Are stashing and slashing different terminology used for same process? Stashing means staked coins gets penalized for acting falsely like chain attack when mining new block.
