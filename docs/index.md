So, this graph is true for inelastic goods like say rice for Nepalese or petrol (we cant escape buying it even if price inc very high). In this graph, every parameter ie. x here price p,  y here quantity q can be cause or x |y can be effect depending on context.
So, equilibrium pt (price p, quantity q) is where buyers demand q, p fulfills or comes to meet at sellers supply q,p in FREE UNEXPLOITED UNBIASED market where there's only one rule: at any time, sellers ASKing for lowest price is prioritized for trade/exchange over other sellers & buyers BIDDing for highest price is prioritized for trade/exchange over other buyers.
So, we can think of it as: ball dropping on bowl ,& it eventually oscillates to settle stable at equilibrium centre of bowl. applies both up and down bowl.
Here's why?
So, lets see purple color case. Here, one seller supplies  30L  /Q now. Since trade is happening at equilibrium (trade is only possible at equilibrium point in FREE market) THIS TIME & this is screenshot of that exact TIME, if he supplies at 30L /Q, then at this rate, market total supply is at 20Q whereas total demand is at just 10Q [Its human nature ðŸ™‚ , theres no rush/ crowd to buy higher than whats trading at] . ie. higher supply than demand at price higher than current trading price.    
So, if wants to really trade at THIS TIME condition, he has to lower his price (hence ball in bowl case) OR he has to wait some time (maybe weeks, months after) ie. t+ t' . 
 Vice Versa with red color case. (hence ball in down bowl case).
So quoted, Free unbiased market acts like invisible hand to promote social goods
      Obviously this graph is ever changing at other significant t+t', just like graph of how much distance from destination will remain changes based on how much distance already travelled. 
      This graph cuts 100% TRUE, REAL and graph is RAPIDLY CHANGING in milliseconds (where equilibrium point is rapidly shifting) in perfect example of FREE MARKET like stock share crypto exchange. and NOT rapidly changing in commodity market, obvious example of rice market.

PS about BUYERS NON BUYERS SELLERS NON SELLERS dim color: lets assume this of SLOW market like that of rice (ie. equilibrium point stays same for days), 
then REALLY willing buyers are ones who BID price higher than THIS TIME trading price & 
REALLY willing sellers are ones who ASK price lower than THIS TIME trading price.

now we can see that p153 graph was infact explaining how when equilibrium point changes at t+t' when Supply aka Supplied aka Asked Price is changed by supplier.
