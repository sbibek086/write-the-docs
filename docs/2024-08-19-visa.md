visa:

migrationalogy by Mark Wiens - food vlogger's website has good stuffs on it.

It is green frog which I do not want to look but know I should look, and so is eating my subconscious soem brain.

Ever since my US visa expired after me not returning within 3 months to US without informing embassy (coz I was here developing AI trading bot), my dejavu has made it bigger than it really is. So, will be looking at it over time
