Growing up autistic child, I cant generally streamline myself to specialization ,and generalization again is not possible in this world of abundant knowledge and competition.

I adjusted myself being integrative to things.
Means I do things from different fields but I am highly narrow focused on what I do.
Eg. I just watch Rajkumar Hirani or Rocky movies. or i just listen Pink floyd songs.
and If I have to write story, then I only follow them. For that, if I have to integrate other skill, then I dont say, I am specialist, I learn them.
But idea is: what I learn new, should integrate or cog fit or support/ reinforce my previous skill.

How?

When I watched Aamir Khan- my fav actor interview, I heard he mentioned, EQ > IQ. Ofcourse, He may be in actor field, where primary selling object is emotion.
But again, EQ is imp for no matter which profession people.
