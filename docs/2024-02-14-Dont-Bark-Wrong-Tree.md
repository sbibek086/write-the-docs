Before learning new tech, I have to know ahead- how it is going to Lego connect or cog-fit to body of my already-knows & my-strengths ,and/or how it's going to 10steps-5steps to my problem soving process. Otherwise, what's the point!

Do it as religion & dont feel lazy to note (rough pen notes if hurry or fatigued) all lessons learnt, mistakes made, corrections- all when I solve some pgm challenge. This note will save me tons of time when I face similar situation challenges in future.
