Before learning new tech, I have to know ahead- how it is going to Lego connect or cog-fit to body of my already-knows & my-strengths ,and/or how it's going to 10steps-5steps to my problem soving process. Otherwise, what's the point!  

Always, listen from the horse mouth about racing if availabe, not from commentator. I would pay first hand about tutorial on system design from Reddit founder than some professor of system design, and likewise.

I recall how in academic times, I could force myself to master at least for paper day, subject as boring as Engineering Materials', which I would now even vomit to look at.
How I was forcing; 
- Peer Pressure: other guys are reading, I should be also reading-herding forceii)
- Social Pressure: What if I fail, I should at least pass, for that I am going to push myself no matter which level
- Air of surrounding: Its like I get automatic religious when I enter Pashupati or I get more academic when I enter or am in college university or in its class
- Continuity touch: Its like, when someone gives same thing to study in university, then continuity of consciousness cumulates all the way back from schooling to force us to master that
- Disciplined breakdown of study: how subjects were in chapters and we progressively move from one chapter to next chapter, gradually building up on previous, not random jpt study

In real life, we know there are so many things we know we need to master yet we cant force devote ourselves to master. WHY? because we cant emulate these above five pressure factors in real life scenarios

NoteToSelf: 
-  make whiteNote style note n be intelligent aware enof to know which is RIGHT Q to gpt.
-  cheatsheets my arse, do problem solving. they are just Ctrl+ Space away in vscode intellisense.
-  read docu in Zen focus while in flow of solving, I dont have to know it beforehand). one fear that was stopping me was- what if it messe with already written code but hey, versioning is for exactly this scenario.
-  Do it as religion & dont feel lazy to note (rough pen notes if hurry or fatigued) all lessons learnt, mistakes made, corrections- all when I solve some pgm challenge. This note will save me tons of time when I face similar situation challenges in future.
