I got timing painfully wrong two times. once buying x at [a]- LESSON: u know its gold, but why so hurry, u got all the time in the world, markets still there tommorrow, u dont have to push ur button everyday or right now. patience on right knowledge foundation

second time selling y at [b], I should have waited n then sold at [c] reap phase.
