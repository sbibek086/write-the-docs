title: (P)Dynamic Hedging- Clarified simply

What exactly is dynamic hedging aka option trading aka derivatives?

hedge means protect. means protect from unforeseeable situation that causes unfair loss to one.

for eg. a farmer F seeds wheat with some investment I. But what if in future, price P (p for profit here, ok) drops due to say excess production in country, {btw if all his wheats die, than thats insurance. this isnt now context}.

So, F wants assurance that his wheat would have certain P. Now, what he can do is: forward contract C till that time of say (upto 1 mo later of wheat harvest time - This is Maturation/ expiration date) saying, ok, no matter what happens, I want that P with my wheat in future. 

{ btw Clearing House acts as escrow between F and say Bank B here, or say between two parties}

{forward contract is defaulted as contract and in this writing, just contract C in derivative instrument- yes, this is called derivative market} {and future contract is not opp. of it but just more strict form of forward contract}

So, party who buys C is entering into a long position, and party selling C enters into a short position. If price of underlying asset(here, wheat) increases, the long position benefits. If underlying asset price decreases, the short position benefits. so, here F is selling. 

Doesnt make sense? then, look below:
