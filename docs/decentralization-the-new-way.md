In banking crisis of 2008, expectation of regulator on banking industry weren't met, or in other words expectation of society on regulators. And in some sort, this is endemic to modern world because power structures in modern world are opaque.
These opaque nature of power structures were fine in pre globalization small small block world. With aid of globalization and from 90s, ominent internet, we see bigger and bigger power structure, bigger and bigger corporate structures, multinational corporates. and these power structures are beginning to become very dangerous problematic simply because they place too much unchecked power to large extent in the hands of few.
Decentralization is way of ensuring that these unchecked powers dont go unchecked. It has same check and balances broadly speaking in line with constitution (set of rules of fairness and equity). Its only by having these check and balances, and rules be transparent, and expecting credible reasonable expectations be fulfilled new cyberocracy way.
This decentralizaition tech is contributing big part of it, and is as being cornerstone of maintaining society in rule based international order.
Because World has always favored more to rule based more international order. Eg Post world war, we see rise of more kind of international structures like UN etc. And things are breaking down, rules of game are changing as pre- arrangements couldn't fulfill expectation.
somethings got to give in unless we set up new way of ensuring that internationally on global basis, some rules based order. I see that decentralization tech community has been rapidly building to it.
Decentralization is going to retain and evolve as more transparency, openness, fair power distribution to masses and immutability of code are there for all to see.
