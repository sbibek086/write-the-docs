So, above image is only one example of how crazy, illogical and even self-life-threatening maniac people can be, when allured with Grand money as reward.

This is just one explicit display of people's irrationality. But more dangerou manifestation of such irrationality is hidden in people's consciousness and sub-consciousness more subtly in their daily life. 

Explicitly - when people gamble their life savings all in 1xbet, casinos. taking others lives for money, cheating others money etc. etc.

Subtly - on people's decision when it comes to their financial decisions, 
                    eg: putting position size, robbing their food off table because GREED masked their RISK proactiveness.

So, lets try to visualize all this emotional cocktails on graph, and where is the sweet spot.

_Of course, above graph is not perfect. But I will refine it over time_

In above image, of-course any people with reasonable amount of sanity would be in BIGGER green box zone.
But again, all these emotional internal battles are tested to the heat when they are in financial market session (short term day trading or even long term holding aka value investing).

There is constant battle of emotion between GREED and RISK, and they can be so powerful to interfere with judgement call of even BEST ones.

So, any wise enough ones always say -

I) have self-mastery over yourself.

II) have enough knowledge of market {be it candle sticks for price action day trading or be it macroeco for value investing(you need to know what you are putting your money on & betting for FUTURE)}

Personally, I used to day trader on Covid19 lockdowns and 
I had done below mistakes:
I did II) first and then only knew about (I). 
Then I corrected order of mastery - (I) ,then (II)

After one of my wrong call on value investing on web3 D'iD,

_I am adding this below on different sitting than above article writing-sitting. Tho this context is different but not that different to neccessitate different article._

**Art of Surfing: Disciplined (My Thousands DOLO) Chad Surfing vs Random/ Ad-hoc Surfing**

Story of my Disciplined-Thought Surfing: I remember about 3 4 months before first covid lockdown hit. I was almost nil on my dollar account until miraculously 1100$ came to me as tax refund_ (btw, I cant exactly recall how I got it, maybe coz I had filled tax return w turbotax or sthg like that)_.

So, before bank-nil days, I had bought livepeer token and staked it. staking APR was poor. 

So, I googled 'which gives maximum staking rewards', gives me stakingrewards.com on second google page, went to it. 

I then sorted stakingrewards according to descending rewards percentage, found some other token, which I forgot now and chainx - yes my beloved chainx on second rank with APR 84 %.

I youtubed 'how to stake on chainx, how to create wallet etc.' Needless to say, I bought chainx at 0.25$ then w my 800$ and some other a, b, c w rest.

Here's the more good part: One fine day, I searched on twitter about chainx. Chainx official page had one video on it.

Now, here's how my chad-logical-brain-and-how-I-should-be-thinking thought: If official chainx twitter is putting this guy's video, he must be authentic and not BS. Thats how I found chico crypto, who helped me discover lots of gems at cheap-dirt price.

Also, that's how I found AB. AB's video was uploaded on comment thread on Donnie's twiterpost.

Lesson is: **If you are convinced and smell good gems after cross-checking from reddit reviews, then move towards that direction more. Analogy is: I am in a cave. If I see slight ray, then keep moving to that direction, it will lead me to cave opening.**

Story of my BS-Thought Surfing: I had already found Donnie on twitter. impressed that he bought polka at cents by eth on presale. 

I was hooked. This guy must be good. Spent hour(s) on reading his history tweets. 

my mistake :Sold my soul and brain on his every little saying. **Obsession of big money clouded my rationality and fact-cross-checking-awareness. - DONT DONT** .  
KILT was on his twi-profile-description, and his tweets were worshipping kilt- next BIG thing etc. 

poured my ENS 8000$ airdrop money's about 30% on KILT at 11$ on okex. Was buying on that night like a hungry dog after hot-dog thinking, This is it. 
**Lesson: Buying early on presale is HOME-SWING but buying pumped-things-many-times-pumped-by-exchange-wolfs-themselves aint same thing.**
Turned out and I realized later- Donnie was shilling his crowdloan rewards KILT so that he could sell his KILT at pumped price to then-fool-sheep like me.

Another story was: 1) I used to teach in Grace. and how one day, some staffs were talking about 1xbet crash plane bets. ignored it some months thinking, "ignore words n schemes of someone, who I know are way down than me on IQs". 

but bited me 2 months later- lets try. I was neither L nor P after 1 week latenights- that wasnt loss. But biggest loss was- My valuable attention FANed-OUT away from my dollar-account nil notification's 'do sthg message' and account blew up.

2) I found some unwashed masses of the world talking on comment how there's one glitch on some abc exchange that 1 btc = 10 times more eth that what's correct rate. Tried dissolving cosmos. not loss but some money spilled by exchange fees & hours spilled on worthless pursuit

**Lesson - Never pay attention to people on JHUMRIKALAIYA tempo (I mean comment-people) shouting rich-plans. S/he should have proven self to sthg, IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR MY VALUABLE ATTENTION RADAR.**
