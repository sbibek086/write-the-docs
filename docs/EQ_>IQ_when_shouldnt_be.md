So, above image is only one example of how crazy, illogical and even self-life-threatening maniac people can be, when allured with Grand money as reward.

This is just one explicit display of people's irrationality. But more dangerou manifestation of such irrationality is hidden in people's consciousness and sub-consciousness more subtly
in their daily life. 
Consciously - when people gamble their life savings all in 1xbet, casinos. taking others lives for money, cheating others money etc. etc.
Subconsciously - on people's decision when it comes to their financial decisions, 
                    eg: putting position size robbing of their food on table because GREED masked their RISK proactiveness.

So, lets try to visualize all this emotional cocktails on graph, and where is the sweet spot.

_Of course, above graph is not perfect. But I will refine it over time_

In above image, of-course any people with reasonable amount of sanity would be in BIGGER green box zone.
But again, all these emotional internal battles are tested to the heat when they are in financial market session (short term day trading or even long term holding aka value investing)
There is constant battle of emotion between GREED and RISK, and they can be so powerful to interfere with judgement call of even BEST ones.

So, any wise enough ones always say -
I) have self-mastery over yourself.
II) have enough knowledge of market {be it candle sticks for price action day trading or be it macroeco for value investing(you need to know what you are putting your money on & betting for FUTURE)}

Personally, I am often day trader in holidays and 
I had done below mistakes:
I did II) first and then only knew about (I)
Then I corrected order of mastery - (I) ,then (II)

After one of my wrong call on value investing on web3 D'iD, here is one shorts as if speaking to me
