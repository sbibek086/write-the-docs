gpt:

Uploading code files and letting it analyze has been fav gpt use.

_oh, btw, ensure that you have one brave incase duckduckgo - default brings up cross origin API error, which simply means 'no access' when trying to attach g drive files. so, I jumped over this duckduck's annoying 'no access' just doing from brave_

_n btw vivek, open one terabox so that my gdrive'ss 15GB is purely for my baby clb's code all over._

Bash where possible:
it doesnt always have to be npm docker pip that we install globally on computer.
it can be VivekAwesomePkgs or even ElasticSearchPkgs- why not ?
One of the whole OSS enthusiasm is also about bringing up with new elegant packages.
btw, novice download softwares, or use SaaS. CHADS just install new packages from vscode terminal or simply linux terminal aka bash.
I remember why Brad Traversy just install new pkgs in terminal. and his Equivalent to Windowers Start menu was just terminal with customised pow commands.
it was roughly like :

BradsAwesomePkgs run Open6TabsAtOnce or BradsAwesomePkgs start Antivirus

similar to we do:

npm install -g AwesomeNPMpkgs   or  npm start server or npm install for bootstraping

or  curl whatWhat whatwhat  or gweth (btw it's ethereumPackages) createWallet

or  pip(btw it's Python's) 

EVEN AM just merges from bash.

Github GUI:

Github POWs:

a) Sub-issues now in Issues:

quoted:  GitHub just shipped the largest set of changes to GitHub Issues. As an Issues power-user this is directly relevant to me.

The big new features are sub-issues, issue types and boolean operators in search.

Sub-issues look to be a more robust formalization of the existing feature where you could create a - [ ] #123 Markdown list of issues in the issue description to relate issue together and track a 3/5 progress bar. There are now explicit buttons for creating a sub-issue and managing the parent relationship of such, and clicking a sub-issue opens it in a side panel on top of the parent.

Issue turn out to be organization level feature, so they won't show up on repos that belong to a specific user.

Organizations can define issue types that will be available across all of their repos. I created a "Research" one to classify research tasks, joining the default task, bug and feature types.

Unlike labels an issue can have just one issue type. You can then search for all issues of a specific type across an entire organization using org:datasette type:"Research" in GitHub search.

```
u can search in github as below:
(type:"Bug" AND assignee:octocat) OR (type:"Enhancement" AND assignee:hubot)
```
b) Github CodeSpaces:

Ctr Shift ` for bringing terminal; 

Ctrl shift F for finding code across multiple files in repo. 

_my codespace setting loggedIn by my ghub, ie. my codespace settings belong to my github, so if i sync, then its setting is reflected to no matter other newly created codespaces._  

quoted: Idea of using generative AI for autocomplete in a text editor is a really significant innovation, and is still my favorite example of a non-chat UI for interacting with models.

Copilot can perform prompt-driven rewrites, previewing changes before you click to approve them and apply them to the project.

Today's announcement of a permanent free tier (as opposed to a trial) for anyone with a GitHub account is clearly designed to encourage people to upgrade to a full subscription. Free users get 2,000 code completions and 50 chat messages per month, with the option of switching between GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

I've been using Copilot for free thanks to their open source maintainer program for a while, which is still in effect today:

_People who maintain popular open source projects receive a credit to have 12 months of GitHub Copilot access for free. A maintainer of a popular open source project is defined as someone who has write or admin access to one or more of the most popular open source projects on GitHub. [...] Once awarded, if you are still a maintainer of a popular open source project when your initial 12 months subscription expires then you will be able to renew your subscription for free._

It wasn't instantly obvious to me how to switch models. The option for that is next to the chat input window here, though you may need to enable Sonnet in the Copilot Settings GitHub web UI first:
