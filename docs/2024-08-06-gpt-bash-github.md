LLMs:

-gpt:

a) Uploading code files and letting it analyze has been fav gpt use.

_oh, btw, ensure that you have one brave incase duckduckgo - default brings up cross origin API error, which simply means 'no access' when trying to attach g drive files. so, I jumped over this duckduck's annoying 'no access' just doing from brave_

_n btw vivek, open one terabox so that my gdrive'ss 15GB is purely for my baby clb's code all over._

b) I uploaded msword file and then said, "Please remove blank line after each text line" while in converting pdf layout to my msword's landscape 2-columns msword. GPT accordingly removed and give me in raw text format to copy-paste.

Bash where possible:
it doesnt always have to be npm docker pip that we install globally on computer.

it can be VivekAwesomePkgs or even ElasticSearchPkgs- why not ?

One of the whole OSS enthusiasm is also about bringing up with new elegant packages.

btw, novice download softwares, or use SaaS. CHADS just install new packages from vscode terminal or simply linux terminal aka bash.

I remember why Brad Traversy just install new pkgs in terminal. and his Equivalent to Windowers Start menu was just terminal with customised pow commands.

it was roughly like :
BradsAwesomePkgs run Open6TabsAtOnce or BradsAwesomePkgs start Antivirus

similar to we do:

npm install -g AwesomeNPMpkgs   or  npm start server or npm install for bootstraping

or  curl whatWhat whatwhat  or gweth (btw it's ethereumPackages) createWallet
