gpt:

Uploading code files and letting it analyze has been fav gpt use.

_oh, btw, ensure that you have one brave incase duckduckgo - default brings up cross origin API error, which simply means 'no access' when trying to attach g drive files. so, I jumped over this duckduck's annoying 'no access' just doing from brave_

_n btw vivek, open one terabox so that my gdrive'ss 15GB is purely for my baby clb's code all over._

Bash where possible:
it doesnt always have to be npm docker pip that we install globally on computer.

it can be VivekAwesomePkgs or even ElasticSearchPkgs- why not ?

One of the whole OSS enthusiasm is also about bringing up with new elegant packages.

btw, novice download softwares, or use SaaS. CHADS just install new packages from vscode terminal or simply linux terminal aka bash.

I remember why Brad Traversy just install new pkgs in terminal. and his Equivalent to Windowers Start menu was just terminal with customised pow commands.

it was roughly like :
BradsAwesomePkgs run Open6TabsAtOnce or BradsAwesomePkgs start Antivirus

similar to we do:

npm install -g AwesomeNPMpkgs   or  npm start server or npm install for bootstraping

or  curl whatWhat whatwhat  or gweth (btw it's ethereumPackages) createWallet

Github GUI:

a) Sub-issues now in Issues: github just shipped the largest set of changes to GitHub Issues. As an Issues power-user this is directly relevant to me.

The big new features are sub-issues, issue types and boolean operators in search.

Sub-issues look to be a more robust formalization of the existing feature where you could create a - [ ] #123 Markdown list of issues in the issue description to relate issue together and track a 3/5 progress bar. There are now explicit buttons for creating a sub-issue and managing the parent relationship of such, and clicking a sub-issue opens it in a side panel on top of the parent.

Issue turn out to be organization level feature, so they won't show up on repos that belong to a specific user.

Organizations can define issue types that will be available across all of their repos. I created a "Research" one to classify research tasks, joining the default task, bug and feature types.

Unlike labels an issue can have just one issue type. You can then search for all issues of a specific type across an entire organization using org:datasette type:"Research" in GitHub search.

```
u can search in github as below:
(type:"Bug" AND assignee:octocat) OR (type:"Enhancement" AND assignee:hubot)

Ctrl shift F for finding code across multiple files in repo. 
```
