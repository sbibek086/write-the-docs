Wheel (.whl) 
{follows pep427 formatting std}
{zip archive that has compiled binary files(.so, .dll, .pyd for C/C++ extension modules), .py, metadata files (child wheel, setup.py etc)} . 
- Since it has compiled bin files, it lets precompiled packages to be installed without need for building from source; as result- Users do not need to have build tools (like a compiler) installed on their system to install a package from a wheel. And also wheels ensure that same binary package can be installed across different environments, reducing the variability that can arise from building packages on different systems.
- can be platform-specific (linux or macOS..) or universal

```
Wheels in .tar.gz or .zip means whatever children grandchildren packages there are
inside to make one meaningful functional entity (may be package, libraries etc),
we are just precompiling all children grandchildren packages within
(by going through intermediate process of setup.py or metadata etc etc),
such that they are in binary format so that no large time is wasted
whenever we are putting that functional entity in new VM or our local machine.
why? because grandchildren children package are already compiled

So, if wheel couldnt be built? then its because grandchildren package might be incompatible
w children package (dependency conflict stuffs).

common sense if we understand under-the-hood
```
To install: pip install somepackage.whl
for package maintainer,  wanting to distribute package as a wheel: pip install wheel
Navigate to your package directory and run: python setup.py bdist_wheel
This command will generate a .whl file in the dist directory of your package.
