yo mathi ko image ma before compilation, k thyo, after compilation k vayo, her, tye ho runtime.

When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter is loaded, along with any necessary libraries (runtime environment), before executing the script.

more such debian aka OS and non-debian aka non-Os package instllation conflict is taken care by PEP-668, which ensures that system-installed Python environments (like those provided by Linux package managers) are protected from accidental modification by tools like pip.

Why? -- so as to prevent conflicts or breakages when users install packages directly into system Python using pip, which can mess up OS-managed software.

What it does:
Introduces a marker file:
/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED
(or similar, depending on the OS and Python version)

If this file exists:

pip install into the system environment will fail unless:

The user uses a virtual environment OR

Adds --break-system-packages (to override)

Impact:
Encourages use of virtual environments (e.g., venv, virtualenv)

Protects system Python from unexpected breakage
