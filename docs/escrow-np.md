In trade, Farmer(F) gives his products to Customer(C) in return of money.

But what if C says, "but I didnt find product eg veggies as I saw in photo, I wont pay you money for that". It would be huge loss of time money on side of F and Driver(D).
Hence the need for escrow - a middler who middlewares cash such that C has to deposit money first so that he couldnt act as aforementioned.

National.Clearing.House.Ltd's connectips has been middlewaring this such that 
- paid amount is locked, not released to F
- both C and F gets to see it in their dash.

Its matter of paying API subscription per hour or per number - idk now how they are serving this. Even khalti esewa may have been escrowing by now - idk

Then is Product Dispatch & Delivery where D picks up the order.
During delivery:  D shares live GPS location, takes photo proof of pickup and drop-off via app (I think its too much now for just MVP).

Lastly,
- if C inspects goods, ticks ok so that escrow releases fund to F.
- if C doesnt tick ok within 12 hrs, still escrow releases fund to F.
- if C disputes quality, funds is hold n dispute resolutioners come n check case by: Photos of product, Delivery logs, Product listing details 
n then either does Partial refund, or reject with return (driver reverse-picks), or full payment if foul play suspected from buyer.
