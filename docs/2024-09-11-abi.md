Like in  cli comand,

here, functionality: sw functionality that solves some purpose

existing entity: cli cmd

consumer: user

in API, 
existing entities: api fns,  better correctly said, interfaces in interface based programming ,

consumer: another aka main program where that API is called NOT user, 
functionality lies behind this layer ie. functionality happens in library where it is called.

like in from scipy.optimize import linprog(args, args WhatWhatICantRecall) then use it as output = linprog(args, args2Etc) 
where linprog is API whose output, this main pgm is using as consumer but functionality is hardcoded in scipy.optimize library

abi is just api in 01 ie machine level as name 'application binary instead of permission interface' is self explanatory. 

api consists of data types/ structures, constants, fns that i can use in my code to access functionality of that external component aka api.

abi is just compiled version ie machine level version of api. 
when i write source code, i access library thru api. once code is compiled, under-the-hood application accesess binary data in library thru abi. 
abi defines structures n methods that my compiled application will use to access external library(just like api did), but this time only on lower level. 

api defines order in which i pass args to function. abi defines mechanics of how these args are passed (registers, stacks etc). api defines which fns are part of library. abi defines how code is stored inside library sothat any pgn using my library can locate desired fn and execute it.

abi becomes quintessential when it comes to application that use external library. as lib are full of code n other resources, n since pgm has to know how to locate what it needs inside library file, abi defines how contents of library are stored inside file, n my pgm uses abi to search thru file and find what it needs. if everything in my system conforms to same abi, then any pgm is able to work w any library file, nomatter who created them. linux n windows use different abi, so windows pgm dont know how to access library compiled for linux.

```
to quote " Sometimes, ABI changes are unavoidable. When this happens, any programs that use that library will not work
unless they are re-compiled to use the new version of the library.
If the ABI changes but the API does not, then the old and new library versions are sometimes called "source compatible".
This implies that while a program compiled for one library version will not work with the other,
source code written for one will work for the other if re-compiled.

For this reason, developers tend to try to keep their ABI stable (to minimize disruption).
Keeping an ABI stable means not changing function interfaces (return type and number, types, and order of arguments),
definitions of data types or data structures, defined constants, etc.
New functions and data types can be added, but existing ones must stay the same.
If, for instance, your library uses 32-bit integers to indicate the offset of a function
n you switch to 64-bit integers, then already-compiled code that uses that library
will not be accessing that field (or any following it) correctly.
Accessing data structure members gets converted into memory addresses and offsets during compilation
n if the data structure changes, then these offsets will not point to
what code is expecting them to point to and the results are unpredictable at best.

An ABI isn't necessarily something u will explicitly provide unless you are doing very low-level systems design work.
It isn't language-specific either, since (for eg) C application n  Pascal application can use 
same ABI after they are compiled."

I was surprised this is how schema is also written. context may be entirely different for schema but atleast way schema also breaks down each table col to differnt property is similar:
