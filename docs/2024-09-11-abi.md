Like in  cli comand,

here, functionality: sw functionality that solves some purpose

existing entity: cli cmd

consumer: user

in API, 
existing entities: api fns,  better correctly said, interfaces in interface based programming ,

consumer: another aka main program where that API is called NOT user, 
functionality lies behind this layer ie. functionality happens in library where it is called.

like in from scipy.optimize import linprog(args, args WhatWhatICantRecall) then use it as output = linprog(args, args2Etc) 
where linprog is API whose output, this main pgm is using as consumer but functionality is hardcoded in scipy.optimize library

abi is just api in 01 ie machine level as name 'application binary instead of permission interface' is self explanatory. 

api consists of data types/ structures, constants, fns that i can use in my code to access functionality of that external component aka api.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13583da9-babe-4dda-949f-e94bedf8da07)

abi is just compiled version ie machine level version of api. 
when i write source code, i access library thru api. once code is compiled, under-the-hood application accesess binary data in library thru abi. 
abi defines structures n methods that my compiled application will use to access external library(just like api did), but this time only on lower level. 

api defines order in which i pass args to function. abi defines mechanics of how these args are passed (registers, stacks etc). api defines which fns are part of library. abi defines how code is stored inside library sothat any pgn using my library can locate desired fn and execute it.

abi becomes quintessential when it comes to application that use external library. as lib are full of code n other resources, n since pgm has to know how to locate what it needs inside library file, abi defines how contents of library are stored inside file, n my pgm uses abi to search thru file and find what it needs. if everything in my system conforms to same abi, then any pgm is able to work w any library file, nomatter who created them. linux n windows use different abi, so windows pgm dont know how to access library compiled for linux.

I was surprised this is how schema is also written.
