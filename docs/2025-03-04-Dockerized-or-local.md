I thought why not do dockerized way as I didnt want to have headache of virtual environment setpu after bitten by pip pipx confusions when my ubuntu troubles me - if you want to install it as debian os packages or application packages. You know what I'm talking about, ubuntu-ian.

So, I thought- lets minus this headache and directly do [dockerized way](https://sbibek086.github.io/write-the-docs/dockerized-django.html), but turns out- whenever I have to make minor changes, then ci/cd check it aka unit test it, then I have to docker compose down n up every time.
Moreover, to see whats happening inside say postgresql container or web container, then we need to go inside that container which is again bit of lingo headache {which would have been matter of seeing in bash section in vscode if it were done on localmachine's venv way} 

unit test are too much important as I had that feel of pytest leverage while back as QA. moreover, the GOAT himself pitches unit test etc in [here](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jan/12/how-i-build-a-feature/#development-environment)

What to do, what not to, so I deepseeked n then got
```
1. Local Virtual Environment

Pros:

Simpler:

Lightweight: Minimal setup and resource usage; tools like venv or virtualenv isolate Python dependencies.

Faster Iteration: Directly edit code and see changes without container rebuilds.

Ecosystem Support: Most tutorials and IDEs assume a local setup, simplifying debugging and integration.

Cons:

Environment Inconsistencies: Potential issues when collaborating or deploying (e.g., OS-specific dependencies like databases).

Manual Configuration: Requires managing non-Python services (PostgreSQL, Redis) locally.

When to Use:

-The project is small, solo, or experimental. -You prioritize rapid prototyping over deployment concerns.

2. Dockerized Setup
Pros:

Consistency: Replicates production environments, avoiding "works on my machine" issues.

Isolation: Bundles all dependencies (Python, databases, caching) in containers.

Scalability: Simplifies adding services (e.g., databases with docker-compose).

Team/Deployment Readiness: Streamlines onboarding and deployment to container-friendly platforms (AWS, Heroku).

Cons:

Learning Curve: Requires understanding Docker concepts (images, volumes, networks).

Initial Overhead: More setup time for Dockerfiles and configurations.

Resource Usage: Containers consume more memory/CPU than virtualenvs.

When to Use:

- You foresee scaling the project or integrating multiple services.  - Collaboration is a priority (e.g., team projects).
- You want to align development with production early (e.g., using the same database engine).

Recommendation
For Beginners: Start with a local virtual environment. Focus on learning Django’s core concepts first. Once comfortable, transition to Docker for environment consistency and deployment prep.

For Team Projects or Complex Apps: Begin with Docker. It ensures uniformity across environments and simplifies dependency management, even if the initial setup is more involved.

Hybrid Approach: Use a virtual environment for Django code while Dockerizing auxiliary services (PostgreSQL, Redis). This balances simplicity with consistency for critical components.

Final Note: If you eventually plan to use Docker, adopt it early to avoid retrofitting later. However, prioritize learning Django fundamentals first if Docker seems overwhelming. Both approaches are valid—choose based on your immediate needs and growth plans! "

OK. so hybrid approach is it what I should aim for - idk now!
