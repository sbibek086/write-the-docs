by ssh, Tunneling aka Port Forwarding: SSH can tunnel other protocols, allowing secure forwarding of ports and services.

Local Port Forwarding aka (Standard or default understood Tunneling) : Forwards traffic from local port to remote server. 
aka Forwards local port to remote destination.

Remote Port Forwarding (Reverse Tunneling): Forwards traffic from a remote port to a local machine.
aka Forwards remote port to local destination.

Just for curiosity cat of how https ssl/ tsl certificate works?

Encryption and decryption of intransit data and session keys (which lets server and client ensure each other they are on same timestamp and same session, put simply, session keys lets both s and c know it is happening on same single sitting when i open transact on say esewa pathao etc.) is tricky.

now, how do server and client know that they have same encryption decryption protocol, put simply, how do both know that for eg. when server says balanalanala , then client should understand banana.

welcome to SSL/TLS certificate stds that are set by Public.Key.Infrastructure body.

ssl tsl certificate works below while on ssl tsl handshake betn s and c:
