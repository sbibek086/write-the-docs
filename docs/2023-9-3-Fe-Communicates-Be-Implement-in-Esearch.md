This post is continuation to my earlier [FE BE post](https://sbibek086.github.io/write-the-docs/2023-04-09_How_FE_Communicates_BE_vversa.html)

Thanks to [Borislav Hadzhiev](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-cdk-tutorial-typescript) for inspiring me to write such journals. At least, I am enjoying on this beautiful, limitless, boundless, all-world-served-at-once deep game of code => game of today's life instead of horses camels bigBrains wasted activities.

Thanks to CTO - friend colleague for pushing me to achieve this. Although I doubt I can produce this code on my own at this time of writing but atleast I feel satisfied to understand how schematic diagrams are being coverted to actual code. I think this enqualifies me to industry test code quality if I need to.
