Think of py as somewhat like English Grammar 
+ somewhere like Maths, where say (a+b)sq = a2 + 2ab + b2 where again a can be again some c+d or c*d ,or
+ even a can be logx with log's own rules doing inside w x. somewhat like that
+ methodically process ideas to solve problem by creating suitable vars, creating suitable funcs or manytimes just mapping to (== import, export, API ) suitable funcsAkaMethods Or AutoFuncs (== constructors), vivek

Classes are used in all sorts of core files development as well, like if we have to inherit parent driver classes to more specific childs
