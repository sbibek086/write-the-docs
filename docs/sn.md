I go gaga about satoshi here and there often.
Things that I notice, admire and try to embody from him:

1. focus on own circle of control: he created btc leveraging network of machines - internet. I used internet to watch cat vids n tv sitcoms.
2. have big implications of knowledge: he used Poisson equation to calculate possibility of if hacker can do 51% attack on established chain. I understood Poisson equation (which is just special case of Normal distribution) to prepare for certs.
3. blue ocean strategy: I dont need to be one more bidder in already sheep-herded competition. Know where big problem has yet been unsolved - very few have leisure out of race to actually think of it.
4. It would take effort and time to solve problems- big or small. Choose big ones.
5. dont change language for the sake of it. he was using C++ to write all headers, libraries, not even using py. Maybe out of compulsion cause he had to write all libraries, headers as well.
6. Stay low-key: world will ultimately have to come down to whats FUNDAMENTAL. hype is short-term. n other is I, who have to mic post when I solve little hard problem or have little more doh'.
7. Sometimes, you solve problems for betterment of world, not for name-ego. satoshi is anonymous and will forever.
8. whats FUNDAMENTAl? - In my case, today, I dissected X-ray'ed all request and response headers, payloads, inititators etc etc. I went down to the very cells of things- this is what I can make impact on from.
9. Being able to come up w schematics of things n then after coding accordingly is right.
10. Boring is NOT boring- real math equation n real science journal are not blood pumping as Avengers: Infinity but it will be enjoyable, if I understand - whats important. Satoshi bothered to dust away n pick up all 1990s failed b-money papers and continually think study about it for 2 years before he actually begaan coding.
11. He did not look for complicated solutions when simple could do the job, but he also did not avoid them, which really is the correct way of coding, thinking or even living.
12. Dont be versatile for the sake of it or false sense of pride by Wow from others but bother being divergent. in his case, he studied economics too besides programming cause economics is intertwined when one sets to make such economic product.
13. Watching other fairy tale story is just time pass. Put self arse to work n believe me, its enjoyable - knowing what I'm doing has real impact n implication. 
14. leaving code open source leverages community input to code. *tho may unsuitmyprj
15. morphy was relevant in 18th century NOT now. now we have computer n compiler to play
